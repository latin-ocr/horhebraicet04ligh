soned their minds with blasphemy and hatred against the
true Messiah and the pure truth of God, Isa. xxix. 13:
“ Because the sear of this people towards me is taught by the
precept of men, therefore the wisdom of their wise men shall
perish,’' &c. May wc not from this original derive the first
original of the rejection of this people? And by how much the
more they are bewitched with the love of their trmlitions, by
so much the more we may suppose them separated from God‚
hardened, and cast off: so that the apostle seems to look
back to times before the murdering of our Lord, when he is
discoursing about the casting off of that nation.

ΙΙΙ. Was not the gospel brought unto and pnblished
amongst the ten tribes as well as amongst the Jews when
the apostle wrote this Epistle? The determination of this
matter seems to conduce something towards the explaining
of this chapter, seeing throughout the whole chapter there
is no mention of the Jews singly, but of Israel.

The gospel was to be preached to the whole world before
the destruction of Jerusalem, Matt. xxiv. 14 : and was it not
to the ten tribes as well as other nations3 It makes for the
affirmative, that St. James directs his Epistle ταῖς δώδεκα
φυλαῖς, to those ten tribes, as well as the other two. But the
apostles wrote to none but to whom the gospel was now come.

Ver. 1 l ε Μὴ ἀπώσατο ὁ Θεὸς τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ; [[αΐΙι Gocl cast
away] leis people ἓ] We may observe what it is the apostle pro-
pounds to discourse, viz. not of the universal calling in of the
nation, but of the non-rejection of the whole nation: hath God
so rejected his people that he hath cast them away univer-
sally‘? μὴ γένοιτο, Gocl forbid. For I myself am an Israelite‚
and he hath not cast me away.

iii. 5: the jasper stone, upon which was inscribed the name
of Benjamin in the breastplate, was the first foundation in
the new Jerusalem, Rev. xxi. 19: in meniory (as it should
seem) of this Benjamite‚ the chief founder of the Gentile
church. ‘⁶ Them jasper of Benjamin fell one day out of the
breastplate and was lost. Dama Ben N ethinah having one like
it, they bargained with him to buy it sor a hundred pence.” &c
