all know what aaz& means in Gen. xliii. ult. they drank
lamely with lcz'm; and Cant. v. 1, ⁸⁸ Drinlc abundantly, O
beloved.'’ VVhere tllc LXX read, ἐμεθύσθησαν μετ’ αὐτοῦ,
tlzeys were clrzmk with Ιιῖηι ; and μεθύσθητε, ἀδελφοί, be yse clmcnk,
brethren. But if you will attribute an ignominious sense to
it, it does not much differ from that liberal pouring in of
wine which was allowed, and used by some in their cele-
brating the Passovers. But the apostle seems to inveigh
against the very use of the thing, namely, against the suppers
themselves, rather than against the abuse of them. For if
the excess of those suppers had been that, which is espe—
cially accused‚ he had bent the force of his reproof more
directly against it; but of that there is not one syllable be-
sides this word.

the contrary, abhorring this Judaizing, and avoiding such
ante-suppers, πεινᾷ, as yet were hunfsry, and approached to
the sacrament tasting, that is, not having supped. And this
we suppose to be the true cause of that enormity which the
apostle corrects, ver. 3 3, namely‚ that they would not “ tarry
one for another :” the Gentile party would not tarry till the
Jewish party had despatched their own time, how much
soever it were, in eating their suppers.

Ver. 23: Ἐγὼ γὰρ παρέλαβον ἀπὸ τοῦ Κυρίου· For l have
received of the Lord.] What need had the apostlc to recur
to this? Did the Corinthians doubt of tho institution of the
Eucharist? or of the authority of the apostlc who delivered
unto them that institution? lt was neither one nor the other:
for they came to the Eucharist, and that because it was deli-
vered thom by tho apostle. But he calls them back hither
for this reason, that from the words of (¹hrist who had insti-
