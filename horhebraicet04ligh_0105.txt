Oh. viii. 32] Exercitate'oozs upon the Acts. 99

However‚ that there was a certain Oandaee queen of the
Ethiopians, nay, that there were several queens of that name,
is so very plain both from Pliny and Strabo, that it would
be an impertinens> thing to seek for this Oanclace of ours any
where else. ‘⁴ The head of the kingdom (saith Strabo) was
Meroe, a city of the same name with the island itself.'⁷ Now
the country Meroe was made an island by the river Nile west-
ward, and the river Astabora eastwarda.

If our eunuch here came indeed from Meroe, then may
we call to mind that passage in Zeph. iii. 10, ‘⁶ From beyond
the rivers of Ethiopia my snppliants‚’' &a But from what
part soever of Candace's empire he might come, and what
way soever he went, that might be true of him, and a very
long journey he must needs take before he could arrive at
Jerusalem. But the Ethiopic version cuts the journey much
shorter when it makes him travelling to the city Gaza3 so
rendering that passage, ὃς ἦν ἐπὶ πάσης τῆς γάζης αὐτῆς, not

rusalem upon the same errand that had brought the Jews
from all countries, Acts ii; viz. led hither by the prophecy
of Daniel, which had foretold the appearance of the Messias
about this time. And one would wonder that whilst he was
at ‚Jerusalem he should have heard nothing concerning ιΙ esus.
Or perhaps what he heard of him was the occasion of his
studying at this time that passage in Isaiah's prophecy.
WVhere now were the apostles and the rest of that- holy col—
lege and company, that so great a person, and one of such
devotion, should be let- go untaught and unsatisfied concerning
the Lord Jews? Is it possible that he could be ignorant
of the talk of his death and resurrection, abiding in the city,
although as yet he might not believe it? but his instruction
and conversion is reserved to a more peculial* miracle, that
should render it the more famous and better known.

Ver. 32: ‘sse πρόβατον ἐπὶ σφαγὴν ἤχθη· He was led as a
sheep to the slansteten] The text in Isaiah is indeed expressed
here according to the Greek version3 but whether the eunuch
