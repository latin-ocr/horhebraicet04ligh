156 Hebrew and Talmudical [Ch. iii. 1 2.

apply it to the Gentiles, as by numberless instances might be
confirmed. These interpreters, therefore, having gotten such
a subJect in this Psalm, and according to the custom of the
nation applying it to the Gentiles3 they heap together pass-
ages from other places of the Scripture, which they either
believe or would have to look the same way, loading and
stigmatizing the poor heathen with odious characters enough 3
for to them the Jews make no doubt, but assuredly believe,
all those things do appertain.

III. Our apostle follows their quotations exactly‚ tran-
scribes their words, appi-oves the truth of the thing, but dis-
proves the falsehood of the application, ver. 19: q.d. “ Y ou
Jews expound these things of the Gentiles only, as if they
did not in the least belong to yourselves. And with the
same design likewise have your interpreters multiplied this
heap of quotations‚ having their eye on them: but ye must
know that whatever things the law saith, it saith to them
who are under the law.''

CHAP. VIII.

VEB. 19: ‘H γὰρ ἀποκαραδοκία τῆς κτίσεως· For tlte earnest
expectation of tlte creature, &c.] There is a twofold key hang-
ing at this place that may unlock the whole, and make the
sense plain and easy.

Ι. The first is this phrase πᾶσα κτίσις, which we render τίιε
whole creation, ver. 223 and we meet with it twice elsewhere
in the New Testament‚ Mark xvi. 15, Κηρύξατεῖ) τὸ εὐαγγέλιον
πάσῃ τῇ κτίσει· I'reccclc the 903]an το every creature. Col. i. 23,
Εὐαγγελίου τοῦ κηρυχθέντος ἐν πάσῃ τῇ κτίσει· Τ he yospel which was
preaclcecl to every creature, Now it is apparent enough what
is meant by πᾶσα κτίσις in both these places, viz. all nations‚
or the heathen world. For that which in St. Mark is κηρύξατε
εὐαγγέλιον πάσῃ τῇ κτίσει, precwh tlte φθερεῖ to ovem] creature, in
St. Matthew is μαθητεύσατε πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, 9⁰ and {each all
viations. The very phrase in this place lays claim to that
very interpretation. Ι have also observed upon that place of
St.Ma1·k, that that phrase ΓΠἾἾΠΠ ³7: which signifies the
same with πᾶσα κτίσις, every creature, is applied by the Jews to
the Gentiles, and that by way of opposition to Israel.
