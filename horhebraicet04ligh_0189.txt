Ver. 5: Παραὸοὒναι τῷ Σατανᾷ· To clelz‘ver mzto Satan]

A few chin-(js concerniny exconzmuniccctz'on amony the Jews. Whe-
tlcer ‘ to excommunicate* amb ‘to deliver to Satan'
among] them were the same.

Being to speak of excommzmz‘cation among the Jews, we must
first speak a little eoneerning ΠΞἾΞ reproqf, which with the
Babyloniam writers was the same with excommunication, ΓΝ

fin· seven days .· as it is said, If her father spit in her face, shall
she not be ashamed seven days? (Numb. xii. 1 2.) Rabbi Chasda
saith, ἶΓῑζῗῖΖ] ΠΞἾΞΣ Ὂῖῗῑῑὶ) “¹73 Our emcommunicacz'on (in
Babylon) is like their repr00s” (in the land of Israel).

These examples are there produced: “ R. Simeon the son
of Rabbi (Judah) and Bar Kaphra sat readingg and when
the place which they read was too hard, R. Simeon said to
Bar Kaphra, W e have need of Rabbi for an interpreter here.
To whom Bar Kaphra, And what ean Rabbi say in this
matter? R. Simeon went away and told this to his father,
who thereupon was angry. Bar Kaphra came to visit him.
He said to him, O Bar Kaphra, Ι knew you not. He knew
what he meant: ΝΠἾΞἺΞ ᾸΠ] therefore lae underwent reproos

that the masters teaeh not their seholars in the streets3 ap-
plying those words mystieally hither, ‘ The eompass of thy
thighs are like jexvels‚' (Cant. vii. 1.) As the thighs are in
secret, so the words of the law are in secret. R. Clcaz‘ja
(ww ΙἿ) came forth, and taught the two sons of his brother
in the street3 that is, Rabh, and Bar Bar Uhannah. Rabbi
heard this and was angry. R. Chaija came to visit him. He
saith to him, &vy O Azja, who shall read to thee in the
street3'' (The Gloss there: ·'‘ He called him &³⁸37 Azja in eon-
tempt: Who shall read to thee in the street, is as much as if
he had said, Begone lienee.”) “ He knew why he uttered
such words against hin1; therefore he took ΠΞἾῖ] the reproqf
sor thirty <lays.''
