concerning it on mount Sinai, but the sacrifice itself was not
offered. R. Akibah saithg, It was offered, and from that
time bath not ceased. But what do I prove” (in these
words), “ Have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by
the space of forty years in the wilderness‚ Ο ye house of
Israel? viz. the tribe of Levi, that had not committed ido-
latry, they offered; but Israel did not offer. And in those
words, ‘ the children of Israel kept the Passovcr in its time,'
seems to be some reproach reflectes} upon Israel; as hinting
that they had observes} no Passover in the wildcrness but
that.”

It is most certain that sacrifices were offered in the striking
of the covenant, Exod. xxiv. ; in the consecration of the altar
and the tabernacle; and in the celebration of that Passover:
and this was all done in Sinai before the fatal decrce passed
of their not entering the land. But it may not without
reason be suspected that the daily sacrifices were continued
after that ti1ne3 for we find live coals upon the altar, Numb.
xvi.46, and it is not to be thought that fire would be per-
petually burning on the altar to no purpose ; but God’s com-
plaint seems to be about the free-will offerings that they
ceased ; and that none made oblatious of their own good will.
Nor let any think it strange that the prophet, and after him
the protomartyr, counts up the time in that round sum of
forty years, when it was indeed but eight-and-thirty and a
half; for so doth God himself, N umb. xiv. 34.

Ver. 43: Καὶ ἀνελάβετε, Sco. Yam? yse t00k2 up, &c .] The
word in Amos is 1355&sz which if we might render with
R. Solomon in the futule tense, And ye shall baa) your idols
with you into captivity‚ as buidens laid upon your shoulders,’'
it would take off a little of the difficulty that otherwise seems
to lie in this passage; for it might be very reasonably ques-
tioned whether the Israelites ever did this in the wilderness :
but then this is directly contrary both to the Greek version
in that prophet, and now to the Holy Ghost in this place,
and to the very scope of the protomartyr in quoting it. For
he speaketh of God as giving up the people to worship the
host of heaven; and straightways suggests that they first
desisted from serving God, and then addictcd themselves to
