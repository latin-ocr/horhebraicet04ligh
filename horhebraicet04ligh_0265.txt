full skill both of the language and of the sense; that so the
foundations of saith might be laid from the Seriptures, and
the true sense of the Scriptures might be propagated without
either error or the comments of men.

The apostle saith, “ Let him pray that he may interpret,”
ver. Ι 3. And ‘ interpretation’ is numbered among the extra-
ordinary gifts of the Spirit. Now let it be supposed that he
spake Latin, Arabio, Persian: either he understood what he
spake, or he did not: is he did not, then how far was he from
edifying himself! And yet the apostle saith, lte tlmtq speaks· in

May he interpret accordiny to his own sense? But the tradition

is this: R. J udah saith, mnis: ΡἹΒΞ) ΞΓἹΠὮΠ He that in-
