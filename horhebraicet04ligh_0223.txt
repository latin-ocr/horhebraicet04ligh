Oh. viii. J, 4.] Εαῑθνσὶτατίοηδ upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 217

Pharisees (separatists) were multiplied in Israel, who ate not
flesh nor drank wine. To whom R. Josua, Why, O my sons,
do ye not eat flesh nor drink wine? And they answered‚
Should we eat flesh of which we were wont to offer on the
altar, and now it is perished? And shall we drink wine of
which we were wont to pour out upon the altar, and now it is
ceased? When a wicked empire ruled over Israel, and decreed
rough things against them, and made the law and the precept
cease from them, and permitted them not to circumcise their
children, they said to R. Josua, It is fit that we resolve among
ourselves not to contract marriage, nor beget sons‚'' &a

Behold men prepared and sworn almost to perpetual ab·
stinence from marriage by reason of ealamities. From the
like cause, also, I suspect some Christians might be in doubt
in the times of the apostles. Our Saviour had foretold that
those times should be very rough that went before the de-
struction of Jerusalem, Matt. xxiv: and that not within the
bounds of Judea only, but that ‘⁶ judgment should begin from
the Temple of God,'’ everywhere, 1 Pet. iv. 17 3 and ‘⁶ a day
of temptation should come upon the whole worlds' Rev. iii. Ζῶ.
So that that prediction being known to the churches, and the
times now inclining towards those calamities, it is no wonder
if concern and care about those straits invaded the Christians,
and deterred very many single persons from marriage.

VER. l ε Οἴδαμεν ὅτι πάντες γυῶσιυ ἔχομεν· IV& know that we
all have knowledye] Γυῶσις, Ᾰηοῖυῖθσῖρθ, of which the apostle
here speaks, is the knowledye of the liberty of the gospel; but
these words are spoken ironically: as if he had said, “ It is
concluded by all, that they know sufficiently that evangelio
liberty; and thereupon some run out into things which are
not convenient. That ‘knowledge puffeth up„ renders men
bold, neglects the consciences of others; and he that in this
sense seems to know something, as yet knows nothing as he
ought to knOW.”
