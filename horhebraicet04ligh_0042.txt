of all that sit down at meat be pronouneed ; and that they all
answer Amen to him when he giveth the blessing.'' Again in
the same place ; “ ΝΟ one of the guests must taste any thing
till he who breaketh bread hath first tasted.'⁷

«ε R. Abbao saith, nvn: *mv ἓν zezen& :ris :wi-i mm
A man is bound on {lte sabbath (lays to break upon two leaves,
because it is written Γῖζὶζῗᾮ DVJK? double broad,qq Exod. xvi. 22.
‘¹ Rabh Issai saith: '⁴'I saw 'Rabh Calina, that he took two
leaves, 717& mm ancl breche but one.5 ’' Instances of this
kind, as to the use of this phrase, are endless.

But now the question is, whether κλάσις ἄρτου, breaking]
of broad, in this place, be to be taken in this sense ; that is,
for common bread, or not rather for bread of the hely eucha-
rist; which question also returns, ver. 46, ‘⁶ breaking bread
from house to house.'’ Now, Ι ask whether ΠὩἜΞ, breaking]
of broad, amongst the Jews, was ever used to denote the
whole dinner, or the whole supper ἓ It signifies, indeed,
that particfflar action by which they began the meal ; but 1
do not remember that I have any where in the Talmudists
observed the phrase applied to the whole meal of dinner or
supper. Y‘F'T‘tyD was the word by which they commonly ex-
pressed the whole repast : but Πζψὶζζῑ, breakinq breed, never3
if I am not much deceived. And Ι doubt that of Beza is but
“ gratis dietum,'’ rather than proved, when he tells us, “ It
came to pass that eating together, and so all the feasts they
were went to make amongst one another, went under the
name of breaking] os breacl.'' Which if true, I ingenuously
confess my ignorance : but if false, then κλάσις ἄρτου, or break-
ing] of broad, in these places we are now upon, must not be
understood of their ordinary eating together, but of the Eu-
charist 3 which the Syriae interpreter does render so in express
terms : a parallel to which we have in ι Cor. x. 16 ; Acts xx. 7.

To repeat here what is disputed concerning the Essenos and
Therapeutae, is to say the same thing over and over again:
but what is said of the Jerusalem writers, and is not so ob-
vious, I cannot omit; viz. that they did not hire either houses
or beds in Jerusalem: those things were not niercvnary„ but
