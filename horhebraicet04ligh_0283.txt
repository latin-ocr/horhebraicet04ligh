Ch. xvi. 2.] Exercitations upon 1 Epist. Corinth. Νι ι

ΙΙ. The ‘Lord's day' sufficiently commended itself by its
own authority; nor could the institution of it at all be
doubted by the converted Gentiles, as never lmowing, or at
least owning, any other sabbath: nor by the converted Jews
if they acknowledged Jesus for the true Messias; because
they had learned in their schools that Messias should malie
a new law, as Moses had made the old. And that also
which they had drunk in from their cradleS, that Messias
should not abolish the institutione of Moses, but raise them
higher‚ and make them more splendid, although it might be
more a scruple among them of the abolishing the J ewish sab-
bath, yet it could make none of superinducing the Christian
sabbath.

ΙΙΙ. In that controversy of the change of the sabbath from
the J ewish to the Christian, which some prosecute too much
without any cause, they reckon the Scriptures' silence con-
cerning the institution of the ‘ Lord's day ' for a denial of the
thing: as if it were by no means to be believed because it is
not expressed in plain words.

Among many things said in that case, let us put in these
few ε

Ι. The holy text, indeed, is silent of this matter while the
scene of Christian affairs is lying in Judea, mention being
only made by the evangelists of the appearances of Christ on
‘ the first day of the week 3' namely‚ on that day wherein he
arose from the dead, and ‘ the first day of the week' following,
John xx. 26. But when the scene is transferred to the Gen-
tiles, then there is very open mention of it; namely, in this
place, and Acts xx, 7, and Rev. i. 10.

Π. For the chief care concerning mentioning the sabbath
was this, that mention might be made of that sabbath which
was to be among the Gentile ehurches, and was to endure for
ever. And of that, mention is most evidently made in the his-
tory of those churches.

III. Therefore the former silence does by no means argue
that the apostles and disciples in Judea, converted to the
saith, did not celebrate ‘ the Lord's day‚' or that they ob-
served it not by divine institution; but by good right and
reason the mention of it is reserved to its most proper place„
that is, in the story of the Gentile churches.
