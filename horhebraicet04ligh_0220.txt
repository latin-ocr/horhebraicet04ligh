Now, J ew, tell mc, whether circmnoision is any thing,
especially whether it =be of so much account, either to justi-
fication or to sanctification, as you esteem it, when an
Israelite might be a true Israelite, and a priest a true priest,
without circumcision.

ΙΙ. Oirczmzcz‘sz‘on is methin-q in respect of the time3 for now
it is vanished, the end of it, for which it had been instituted,
being accomplished. That end the apostle shows in those
words, Rom. iv. Ι 1, σφραγῖδα τῆς δικαιοσύνης τῆς πίστεως τῆς ἐν
τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ· α seal of the rifshteousness of the saith in ancir-
c'mncc‘sz'on. But I sear the words are not sufficiently fitted by
most versions to the end of circumcision, and the scope of
the apostle3 while they insert something of their own. The
French translation thus; “ Sceau de la justice de foi, laquelle
il avoit durant le pre'puce :²³ A scal of riyhteozcsness qffizilh
which he had clszm'ozy ‘zwzcircumcisiom The Italian thus ; ‘⁴ Sogno
della giustitia della fede, laquale fu nella inci1·concisione:” A
saal qs the rlgylzteousness of the saith, which was without circum-
cis-ion. The Syriac reads, ΓῑΓἿὊζδἿΠἼ &num-i &izi-im,
And a saal of the rifjhteousness ⁰f his saith. The Arabic, “ Of
the righteousness of saith, {NJ ³7³7& which was in uncircum-
cision.⁷’ Others to the same sense3 ‘ as though circumcision
were given to Abraham for a sign of that righteousness which
he had while as yet he was u11ei1·euineised;' which we deny
not in some sense to be true; but we believe circzomcision
especially looks far another way.

Give me leave to render the words thus; “ And he received
the sign of circumcisioii, a seal of the righteousness of the
saith which should hereafter bc in uncircumcisionz'’ I say,
‘ Which should be,' not ⁶ which had been ,³ not which had been
to Abraham as yet uncircumcised, but which should be to his
seed uncircumcised, that is, to the Gentiles that should here-
after imitate the saith of Abraham.

For mark well upon what occasion cz'rcamcision was ap-
pointed to Abraham, laying before your eyes the history of
it, Gen. xvii. ,

First, This promise was made to him, “ Thou shalt bc tho
father of many nations,'’ [in what sense, the apostle explains
in that chapter 3] and then a double scal is subjoined to esta-
