sion soever there was of it, from that. ordinary oustom of the
Jews, it is easy to juslge of that phrase, λειτουργούντων, veinis-
τενὶηρ, viz. that a publio fast was celebrated with the publio
assembly of the ohuroh and administration of holy things:
which whether it was so done, ver. 3, where it is said, τότε
νηστεύσαντες καὶ προσευξάμενοι, then they fastecl ancl prayec‘l,
may be some question: that is, whether at that time there
was a public fast of the whole olmroh, or a more private one
amongst the elders only.

promoted his disciples also: but this honour the wise men in-
dulged to old Hillel; namely, decreeing that no person should
be ordained to an elder but with the lieence of the president.
But neither is the president to ordain any person unless 'the
vioe—president assist hin1; nor the vioe-president, unless the
president assist him. But as to what belongs to the other
soeieties, it is lawful for one man to ordain with the allowance
of the president: but let him have two more with him3 for it

out of the land0.”

It might not be unworthy our inquiry‚ if there were place

Christian ohuroh. But perhaps some will ask, upon what
