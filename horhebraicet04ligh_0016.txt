mausled them to Jerusalem. a plaee which, having tainted
itself with the blood of their Lord„ they might probably have
very little mind to return to again, had it not been by some
special command: and do we think they would have gone
thither to have celebrated the feast of Pentecoet, or indeed
have been present all at it in that place, had not their Master
directed them so to do ’Ξ

Ver. 6 : Εἰ ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ τούτῳ ἀποκαθιστάνεις τὴν βασιλείαν τῷ

lt is very apparent, that the apostles had the same faneiful
conceptions about the earthly reign of Christ with the rest of
that nation: but yet they seem here a little to doubt and
hesitate, either as to the thing itfsolfi or at least as to the
time3 and that not without cause. considering some things
which had so lately fallen out. ‘ Lord, wilt thou restore the

times or the seaSO11S‚” does not in the least hint any such
kingdom ever to be; but he openly rebukes their curiosity in
inquiring into the times, and in some measure the opinion
itself, when he tells them, that “they should receive power
from heaven, and should be his witnesses‚’' Sco.

What that nation apprehended eoneerning the temporal
reign of the Messias, as to many things they speak plainly
and openly enougl1; but in other things a man may inquire,
but ean hardly satisfy himself what they mean or intend. To
omit others, they are in three things somewhat obscure:

Ι. ΧἯῑρῖΙιθι· the ten tribes be to be admitted to the felici-
ties of this reign? For as to this matter it is disputed by the
Rabbins. “ The ten tribes are not to return¹¹.” But in the
Jerusalem Tahnudists it is express-ed thus : ·· The ten tribes
have not a part in the world to come, ἻἾἾὩζῖ ΓΝἾἾ ἶΓΝἸ
