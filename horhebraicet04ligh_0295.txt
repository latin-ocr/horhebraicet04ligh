II. That the blood of the stock of David remained more
noble in Babylon than that which aseencled in the family
of Hillel: because that was of the male seed, this, of the
femaleQ.

ΙΙΙ. Yea, this prevailed wit-h them in the Talmudic times:
“ It is forbidden to go out of Babylon into another land, even
from Pombeditha to Be Cubi3 and Rabh «Ioseph excommu-
nicated one who went from Pombeditha to Be Cubif’

And if we would propound some specimen of the nume-
rousness of the Jews inhabiting that land, we might take a
view of their three universities under those times, viz. at
Naardea, Sora, and Pombeditha3 as also divers other places
famous for Rabbins, such as,

Bethdoli‚ where R. Nehemiah wass. W hieh is also called
BedeliS.

The river Pekod, where R. ,Jacob wast.

Bagdat‚ where R. Channah wasu.

Coreonia, where R. Chaijah x·

The town Mahaziah, where were dootors equal with those
of Pombedit'nay. But let us offer some kind of geographieal

That is, the Glosser being interpreter, ‘⁶ In Babylon the Jews
are of pure blood: in Meson, all are illegitimate: in Media,
many are of pure blood and many not: in Persia, there are
very many not of pure blood, and a few that are pure.”
