that in a inan sworng upon his Iustis? Yon will say, Perhaps
it might corneto pass that it might have such an effect. But

he speaks not of a fortuitous effect, bnt of a certain or nn-
doubted one.

These are the reasons, to omit others, whcreby we are led
to be of their opinion who interpret the place of a iniraculous
action, namely, of the real delivery of this person into the
hands and power of Satan, to be scourged by him, and tor-
mented by him with diseases‚ tortures, and affrightments.
And the phrases used by the apostle about this matter, and
the circumstances of the thing itself, do very well accord
hereunto.

Scripture but when there was an apostolic power, as here,

sence' of the parties, as ‘by Peter against Ananias and Sap-
phira, and by Paul against Elymas3 and liloewise, as it is very
probable, against Hymeneus and AlexandOM yet he being
now a great way distant and remote, “ ‘I have judged' (saith
he) ‘and dem-eod* to exercise at a distance this iny power
against this wicked man, as though I were present and before
his face 3²² which indeed was not ordinarily done, but this was
not an ordinary wiclwtlness.
