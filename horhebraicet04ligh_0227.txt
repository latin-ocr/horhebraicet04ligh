the gospel should be sustained by the gospel.''

Paul saw the Lord twice. First, in his journey to Damascus,
when he was marked out for an apostle3 secondly, in his
trance at Jerusalem, when he was marked out for the apostle
of the Gentiles, Acts xxii. 21. He alone among the apostles
saw the Lord after his ascension.

Ver. 3: ‘H ἐμὴ ἀπολογία· My apoloqy, effa] The apoloffy
itself follows, ‘⁶ Have we not powe1·,'' &c unto ver. ¹5· The
necessity of his apoloyy waS, that he was accused by some of
receiving maintenance from heathen churches for his preach-

the holy things, besides those who served at the altar: con-

wood which was to be laid upon the altar: who being touched
and infected with some spot were not fit to minister at the
altam but they were deputed to this office, and nourished
out of the consecrated things.
