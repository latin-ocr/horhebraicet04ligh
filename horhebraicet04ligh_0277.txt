Oh. xv. 31.] Exercitations upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 271

Upon that law thus R. Bechai; ‘⁸ He that toucheth a dead
body is to be purified with the water of purification with
ashes ; namely‚ those of the red cow, which purifies him that
is defiled by the dead. XVhence arose among us the custom
of washing hands when we come from a dead person3 'mn

niman nvi-514²) mn 32, and intimatas also the resurrection
of the damst* But aster what manner doth it do that? Hear
Zohary upon that matter: “ The spirit of uncleanness dwells
upon men by reason of the dead. ΝΓΠὊΝ *Nm But what
remedy have they? That which is written, paim* mm? ³72⁵&
And they shall return to their αἰνεῖ ,· that is, to the dust of the
burnt red cow, whereby they arc purified. And the spirit of
uncleanness departs, and another holy spirit is shed abroad.
God gave Israel counseL that they should use all manner of
remedies whereby they might obtain the life of the world to
come; namely, that they be found pure in this world and
holy in the world to come. Concerning whom it is written,
‘l will sprinkle upon you pure water, and ye shall be puri-
fied‚’ ’³ Ezek. xxxvi.

We cannot omit thatZ: “ Anciently it was a custom to
baptizo vessels over women dying] in their monthly courses,

struous women that were alive blushed. Therefore they ap-
pointed to baptize over all women, for the honour of men-
struous women that were alive. Anciently they baptized
over profluvious men departed3 for which the profluvious
men that were living were ashamed. They appointed there-
fore that they should baptize over all men, in honour of the
profluvious men that were alive.”

Ver. 31: Νὴ τὴν ὑμετέραν καύχησιν, ἣν ἔχω, &Q [protest
by your rejoz'ciny which I have, &ost That which the apostle
asserts is this, that he died daily3 that is, was trod upon,
suffered contempt, underwent danger, expected death. And
that this is so I appeal, saith he, to your boastiozy, O ye Oo-
rinthians. But in what sense is that boastiozy to be under-
stood? Not t-he apostle's boastiozy of them; for then it
would more properly have been said, ἡμετέραν καύχησιν, om·
