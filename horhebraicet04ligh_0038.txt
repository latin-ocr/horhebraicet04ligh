paim of death] Let these ὠδῖνας θανάτου be either the ‘pallas'
of death, οι· the ‘hands' of death, yet it is doubtful whether
St. Peter might- speak only of the death of Christ, or of death
in general: so that the sense may be that· God raised him
up, and, by his resurrection, hath Zoosecl tlte hands of death
with respect to others also But supposing the expression
ought to be appropriated to Christ only, (whom, indeed, they
do chiefly respect), then by ὠδῖνας θανάτου we are not to un-
derstand so much the torments and pan-sss in the last moments
of death as those bands which followed3 viz. the continued
separation of soul and body, the putrefaction aud corruption
of the body in the grave; which two things are those which
St. Peter acquits our Saviour from in the following words.
For however it be a great truth that death is the wages of
sin, yet is it not to be understood so much of those very
pangs whereby the soul and body are disjoined, as the con-
tinuation of the divorce bctwixt soul and body in the grave.

Ver. 27: Οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψεις τὴν ψυχήν μου εἰς ᾅδων ΤΙιοῑι
wilt not leave my soal in hela] lt is well known what the word ’
ᾅδης signifies in Greek authors3 viz. tlze state of the (lead, be
they just or unjust. And their eternal state is distinguished
not so much by the word itself as by the qualities of the per-
sons. All the just, the heroes, the followers of religion and
virtue, according to those authors, are in ᾅδης, lecules; but it
is in Elysium, in joy and felicity. All the evil, the wicked,
the unjust, they arc in kades too; but then, that is iu hell,
in torture and punishment. So that the word kades is not
used in opposition to heaven, or the state of tho blessed 3 but
to this world only, or this present stato of life : which might
be made out by numberless iustances in those authors. 'she
soul of our Saviour, therefore, κατῆλθεν εἰς ᾅδου, ‹leseemled into
belh i. 0. 110 passed into the state of the dead ; viz. into that
place in kades where. the souls of good 0100 went. But even
there did not God suffer his soul to abide separate from his
body, nor his body to putrefy in the grave; because it was
impossible for Christ to be holden of those bands of death,
seeing his death was not some punidnnent of sin, but tho
utmost pitch of obedience: hc himself being not only without
sin, but incapable of committing any.
