where the mention of the ‘ first feast-day' hints to us that
there is a second, which we find elsewhere asserted in express
terms. “ R. Simeond Ben Jozadek saith, ‘ In eighteen days
any single person repeats the Hallel over 3³ that is to say, iu
the seven days of the feast of tabernacles, in the eight days
of the feast of dedication, the first day of the passover, and
the first (lay of Pentoecost. But in 17ιο captivc'ty they did it in

exactly certain of the precise day, as it had been stated by
the Sanhedrim ; they observed, therefore, two days, that by
the one or the other they might be sure to hit upon the
right.
