to the wife: if either he himself after-ward goes to his wife, 01·
sends a messenger to her, saying, ⁶ The bill of divorce, which
I sent to thee, let it stand for nothing, it is nothing? '') “ A
tradition. In former times he compelled the bench in an-
other place, who would make void the bill, and made not the
thing known to his wife. Gamaliel the elder appointed that
they should not do this; because sometimes the wife, not
knowing of the withdrawing of the bill, lnarrieth another, and
so hath bastard cliildren.”

Behold καταλλαγὴ, α reconciliatam, even after a divorce (but
the apost-le speaks not in this place of divorce): and yet the
Jews by their practice showed that they thought the bend of
marriage was loosed by any divorce; for they admitted second
marriages.

But the present discourse of the apostle turns not- upon this
hinge, namely, whether a son, sprung from parente, whereof
one was a Christian, the other a heathen, be a legitimate issue 3
but whether it be a Christian issue. For it is sufficiently
known that the word ΒἺΗἸἼῙ) ἅγιοι, hely, is very frequently
taken for those that profess Christianity: and 30 the word
ΠἮΤᾩ Ῐιοῖἱηθεε, 111 1110 Talmudists, is taken in a like sense.
