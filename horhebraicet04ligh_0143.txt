01111 conversecl in Jerusalemh. So that it is very improbable
he shonlsl not know eitlnr Ananias the lm'yh„ Priest, if he were
now present, or Ammaee’as the swan, or indeed any of 1110 fathers
of the Sanhednm, if they had any years upon their baeks.

indeed, not a few years had passed since he had left Jeru-
salem : but seeing formerly he had spent so many years there,
and had been of that degree and order that 110 was an officer
of the Sanhedrim, and had a patent- fron] them, he could not
have so slippery and treacherous a memory but that upon his
return 110 00111(1 readily know and distinguish their faces and
persons. And whereas it 18 said in the verse immediately fol-
lowing, that ‘⁶ Paul perceived that the one part were Saddu-
0008,” &a if it should be asked, whence 110 001110 10 distinguish
so well concerning their persons3 it may be answered, that (if
he had no other ways to know them) he might- understand that
by his former knowledge of them: he had known them from
the time that he himself had been a Pharisee, ancl conversed
among them. See chap. xxii. 5.

in obtaining that aceursed commission against the followers
of Christ), but that it must 101010 to his affection rather than
his understanding. So that the sense is, “ Ι knew not that
there was any high priest at all 3⁹² or, “ Ι (10 not acknowledge
this person for such a 0110.” It was safer 10 inveigh against
the person than the office: but if he had said concerning the
very office, “ l do not know that there is any high priest at
all,⁷' I question not but he had uttered his mind; being well
assured that that high priesthood was now antiquated by the
death of our great High Priest J 08118.

For let us lay down this problem : Although the apost-le, as
to other things, had owned the service of the temple (for he
was purified in it), yet as to the high priesthood he did not
own the peculiar ministry of that3 doth it not carry truth
with it, seeing Grod by an irrefragable token. viz. the rending
of the veil of the temple from the top to the bot-tom, had
shewn the end and abolishing of that office?

But suppose the words of the apostle relate to 1110 person
