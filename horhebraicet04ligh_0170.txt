164 Eoeeree'tations upon the Romans. [Ch. xi. 10.

very foreign from the Hebrew truth: and very often use
Greek words in a sense very different from the common idiom
of the Greeks. There might be instances given abundantly
both for the one and the other if this were a place for it.

II. This very word we have in hand they frame to their
own sense, different from the common acceptation of it. And
whether thoy take it from κατανύττω, to ιυνὶελ·9 or from nara-
υυγέω, to 90²5er or have any eye to the word νὺξ, uiolet, they
attribute such a sense and signification to it as denotes
‘ silence. astonishment, horr01·,' &a Gen. xxvii. 38, κατανυ-
χθέντοςΓ δὲ Ἰσαὰκ, (a clause of their own inserting ;) we may
equally render it, Isaac being] amazecl and astmyaed, or *qrieved
(md prioked with sorrow. Psalm lx. 33 ἐπότισας ἡμᾶς οἶνον
κατανύξεως· Thou hest made us to (lrinlc of the wine of com-
panction. The Hebrew is, Πξᾌᾜζὶ 37] the wine of horror. So
that the meaning of the word ’κατανύξεως in them must be
fetched from themselves 3 and in this place, from the Hebrew
word Πῖτᾋῖᾜ-Ἶ in the prophet, rather than from any Greek

lexicon.

Ver. ¹0: Τὸν νῶτον αὐτῶν διαπαντὸς σύγκαμψον’ Bow down
their baala alway] The apostle follows the Greek interpret-
ers, and they their own paraphrastic and allusive way. The
Hebrew hath it, Ἶὲᾩζῖ 7³72ss ΞΠἛΠᾯ make their Zoins to
quake eontinuallys. A'nd so the Chaldee paraphrast renders it
too; but these, ‘ Bow down their back ς’ to which the Syriae
and Arabio incline. It is very true that they whose loins are
weak and seeble do go bowing and trembling3 but perhaps
the interpreters might allude to that in Deut. xxv. 2, 3, where
the malefactor, condemned to be beaten with stripes, must be
bowed down. To which that passage in the Psalmist seems
to allude, Psalm i, “ The wicked shall not rise up, or stand in
judgmentff' The Greek interpreters do frequently allude to
the customs, yea, not seldom to tho traditions of their own
country ς whence one might the rather suspect an allusion in
this place also. Such a kind of version is that, (seeing we
are discoursing about scourging‚) Prov. xxvii. '22; ἐὰν μαστι-
γοῖς ἄφρουα ἐν μέσῳ συνεδρίῳ· tf thou shouldst beat a fool with
stripes in tlte miclst ef the ,s‘anhweclrim : instead of, “ Though
thou shouldst bray a fool in a inorta1·.’'
