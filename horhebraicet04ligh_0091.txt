to Moloch :'' which whether it be the same idol that Ahab
brought in upon Israel might not be unworthy our con-
sidering. There may be some colour and hint of that bloody
worship in what the priests of Baal did to themselves 3 “ They
cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till
the blood gushed out upon then1¹.'’

Moloch (as the Jews describe him) was an image of b1·‚ass
having the face of a calf, his hands open like one 1¹⁷ead) to
receive something brought him from another. And so Dio- “
dorus Siculus describes Saturn of Carthage: ‘Hp δὲ παρ’
αὐτοῖς ἀνδριὰς Κρόνου χαλκοῦς ἐκτετακὼς τὰς χεῖρας ὑπτίας, ἐκτε-
ταμένας ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, ὥστε τὸν συντιθέντα τῶν παίδων ἀποκυλί-
εσθαι, καὶ πίπτειν εἷς τὸ χάσμα πλῆρες πυρός· They had cm
image of Satura made of bross, stretclcz'nq out his hands, θω-
temled towards the earth ,· so that α child being] put into them,
was Heroum and rolled into α areat ,qqu offirem. There we
have also this passage out of Philon concerning the history of
the Phoenicians: Κρόνος τοίνυν, ὃν οἱ ιῘἸΟίνικες Ἰσραὴλ προσα-
γορεύουσι, &Q “ Satura, therefore, whom the Phoenicians call
Israel, having governed that country after his death, was
made the star called Satara, Of his wife Anobret he had
one only-begotten son, whom therefore they call ιῙιῑσῑιιί ‚· that
being the term for an only-begotten son amongst the Phoe-
nicians to this day. Upon the breaking in of a very destruc-
tive war upon the country, he takes his son, and having
decently adorned him, and prepared an altar for him, sacri-
ficed him on it.'' This Israel by name was Abraham by the
character, from whom whether they derived by direful imi-
tation this horrid usage of sacrificing to Moloch, is no place
at present to dispute3 the question rather might be, whether
the Israelites (lid act any such thing themselves in the wilder-
ness; whether with the tabernacle of the Lord they also
erected a tabernacle to Moloch too3 whether, having slighted
the way of sacrificing beasts, they instituted the offering up of
their own children. Which how unlikely it was that Moses
should either suffer it to be done, or having been done should
pass it by in silence, and make no mention at all of it, any
one may judge. Ι shall conclude with that passage in Por-
