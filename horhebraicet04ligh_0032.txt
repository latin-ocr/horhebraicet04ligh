commemorated, but upon a day that might keep up the com-
memoration of himself for ever.

III. NVe can hardly invent a more fit and proper reason
why upon this day they should be ἅπαντες ὁμοθυμαδὸν ἐπὶ τὸ
αὐτὸ, all with one accord in one place, than that they were so
gathered together for the celebration of “ the Lord’s day.” So
that although we have adventured to call it into question,
whether the Holy Ghost was poured out upon the very day of
the Jewish Ρεηίθοοεί, yet have we not done it- with any love
to contradiction, but as having considerable reason so to do,
aud with design of asserting to “the Lord's day'’ its just honour
and esteem: for on that day, beyond all controversy, the
Holy Ghost did come down amongst them.

sary that they also should be endowed with foreign tongues.

ΙΙ. The apostles themselves imparted the same gift by the
imposition of hands to those whom they ordained the min-
isters of particular churehes. It would seem uureasonable
therefore that those extraordinary persons that had been all
along in company with Christ and his apostles, and were to be
the great preachcrs of the gospel in several parts of the world,
should not be enriched with the same gift.

Ill. It is said of the seven deacons, that they were πλήρεις
Πυεύματος ἁγίου, fall ⁰f ilco Holy (most, even before they were
vhoson to that office: which (loth so very well agree wit-h
