58 Hehrew ancl Talmudz'cal [Ch. vi. 1-

I. It is not denied by any but that the Hebrews were Jews
in their original: whether the Hellenists were Jews too is
called in question by some. Beza upon the place denies it:
“ Ἑλληνιστέις, the Hellenists St. Luke means in this place are
those who were of a profane stock, but adopted into the
nation of the Jews by circumcision‚ called therefore proselyto&
For they are mistaken who think those Jews that were dis-
persed amongst other nations were called Ἑλληνισταὶ, Helle-
nists.'’ He thinks this opinion of his is countenanced by that
of Acts xi. 19, 20 : “ Preaching the word to none but unto the
Jews only. And some& of them were men of Cyprus and
Cyrene, which when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the
Hellenists.” From whence Beza infers, “ Whereas the Ἑλλη-
υισταὶ, or Helleni-sis, seem to be opposed to the Jews in this
place, it is plain that by the name of Hellenz'sts, not only the
provincial 01· proselyte Jews are to be understood, that is,
such as wereh here and there dispersed, but even those also
of the Gentiles who are elsewhere by St. Luke termed σεβό-
μευοι, or clevout men‚'’ &e

Let it be grant-ed that the σεβόμευοι, or dec-out men, should
be promiscuously understood with the proselytos, though there
is some difference betwixt them, and that very conspicuous;
yet I see not by what law or authority he should confound
the Hellem'sts with the proselytos. And if those are mistaken
who suppose the Jews that were dispersed amongst other
nations to be called Ἑλληνισταὶ, Helleni-ns, Ι confess myself
willingly to be in that error too. Nor yet would I put all
these Jews that were dispersed among the Gentiles under the
name of IIellenz'sts ‚· not those that were scattcred alnon-gst
the Medes, Parthians, Pershms, Arabiam, and those eastern
countries. Nor do I suppose that he would call thc prose-
lytes of those nations Hellenists, because the very etymology
of the word implies Greez‘sm.

1. Chap. ii. 10, we meet with Jews and proselytes; and
in this chapter we meet with Hebrews and Helloem'sls. We
may most truly say, that the proselytes there arc distin-
guished from the Jews: we cannot at the same time say,
that thc word Helleni-§ts in this place distinguisheth them
