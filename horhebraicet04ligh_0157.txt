the feast of Castor and Pollux within their camp, and had
given themselves to sports and drinking, after dinner Gonip-
pus and Panormus” [two Messenian young men that were
wont to waste the Lacedaenionians] “of a sudden appear
amongst these Lacedaemonians, clothed in white tunics and
purple cloaks‚ mounted. on beautiful horses. The Lacedae·
monians beholding them, and supposing them no other than
Castor and Polluce, and that they were come to their own fes-
tivals, worship them, and make their prayers to them. But
the young men, as soon as they found themselves received in
the midst of them, break through them making slaughter
everywhere with their lances3 and so a great number being
slain they return safe to Andania, casting a reproach upon the
feast of Castor and Pollux‚”

From the habit of these pseudo-Castores, false Castor and
Pollam, it is easy conjecturing in what form they were wont
to be pictured, who in the judgment of the deceived people
were the true ones. Comely young men, in comely apparel,
and riding on horseback ; and yet they are sometimes drawn
on foot, as in that obscure passage in the same Pausaniase,
Τὸ δὲ ἱερὸν τῶν Διοσκούρων ἐστὶν ἀρχαῖον, αὐτοί τε ἑστῶτες,
καὶ οῖ παῖδες καθήμενοι σφίσιν ἐφ’ ἵππων; where the Latin inter-
preter renders it, “The temple of Castor and Pollux is very
ancientf, where young men are beheld sitting on horseback.”
But the words of the author are plainly to this purpose, that
‘¹ Castor and Pollux are drawn standing, and their boys on
horseback.” There is something parallel in another place of
this author that gives some light in this matterg: Μετὰ δὲ
ταῦτα Διοσκούρων ναός· ’Ἀγαλμα δὲ αὐτοί σε καὶ οἶ παῖδές εἰσιν,
’Ἄναξις καὶ Μνασίνους, σύν τε σφίσιν αῖ μητέρες Ἱλάρεια καὶ
Φοίβη, etc. After this is the temple of Castor and Pollux.
They are pictured them-selvo& and their two sons, Anamis and
Mammas, (md toyetloer with them their mothers, Hilarz'a and
Phoebe, done by the skill of Dipoenus and Scyllis ’ἱη ebony wood .-
