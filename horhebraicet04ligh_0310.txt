504 Adclenda to 1 Cor. xiv. - [Ch. ix.

to the nation, and, for the patronising them, many things
seem to be put into the version which favour them, yet this
did by no means so much obtain with them as that they
valued the version above the Hebrew original, and that they,
casting away that, ·made choice of this to thelnselves; but
they always reserved 10 1116 Hebrew text its due honour.

Ι. What 1116 learned among them might judge of the Greek
version, one may somewhat guess from hence, that even a
Christian himself, seriously reading and viewing it, may ob-
serve many things in it whereby he may discover by what
counsels, cautious, and crastiness, that version was published ε
especially if, together with it, he hath in his eye the manners,
traditions, ordinanees, and state of the J ewish nati0n; to
which allusion is very frequently made, and respect had by
those interpreters. The matter may be illustratcd by one or
two exainples as 10 their traditione.

Gen. xx. 18 : ’Ότι συγκλείων συνέκλεισε Κύριος ἔξωθεν πᾶσαν
μήτραν· Because the Lord in shultc'ozq up every womb without.
VVhence comes the putting in of the word ἔξωθεν, without ? It
agrees with the tradition, that the wombs were barred up
against copulation'.

ΕΧοά.8 xxiv. 10: Εἶδον τὸν τόπον οὗ εἱστήκει ὁ Θεός· They
saw tlae place where Gocl Ιιαιί stood, instead of εἶδον τὸν Θεὸν
τοῦ Ἰσραήλ, they saw the G'od qf Israel. Compare the tract
Kiddushint with this3 where the Gloss is this, “ R. Hananael
saith, He that renders &bv-ij& ὟΓῙῑὩξξ-Πζγὶ *ihm-Q] they saw
tlte Gocl of Israel, is a liar,”'&c. Sce 1116 notes before at
chap. xiv. ver. 2.

Deut. xxx, 6: Καὶ περικαθαριεῖ Κύριος τὴν καρδίαν σου, And
tlte Lord shallpmify thy laem-t. And Josh. v. „4va δὲ τρόπον
περιεκάθαρεν Ἰησοῦς τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ· After 10]ιὶοἂ manner
Joslma purlez'ecl the children of Israel, for περιέτεμεν. lae circum-
cis-ecl,- in a sense too much inclining to the trifling praises of
circumcision among 1110 masters.

VVhonce are those words taken? Josh. xxi. 42, and xxiv. 30:
Ἐκεῖ ἔθηκαν μετ’ αὐτοῦ (Ἰησοῦ) εἰς τὸ μνῆμα, εἰς ὃ ἔθαψαν αὐτὸν
ἐκεῖ τὰς μαχαίρας τὰς πετρίνας, &Q There they laid wilh Ῐιῖηι
(ΙοεΙιτια) into the sepulchre, in which they bzcrz‘ed leim‚· I scay,
there they laid tlte εἰοιιιτ l·›zir‹²s,” 15⁴0· And 2 Sani. xxi. 11 5
