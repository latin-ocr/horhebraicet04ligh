I. There is but small logical arguing in this manner, (if
those words were to 116 taken in that sense which they would
have,) “‘ Ye shall sit upon twelve thronest, judging the
twelve tribes of lsrael? therefore all the saints shall judge
the world, as assessors with Christ in the last judgment.''
Which harshness they thus smooth over; “Thatu which he
said to them, he said to all those that should imitate them.''
“ Herex shall be some eininency of the apostles above the rest
of the sczz'nts.'' And so very many others.

II. But ,1 udas was present when these words were uttered
by our Saviour3 and was not he to be concluded within that
number of twelve? But omitting this, there were more also
-present when he said these words, who had ‘followed him in
the regeneration :² and if all they, and all the saints that
should be in the whole world, were 10 be concluded within
that privilege of sitting with Christ upon the bench, why is
the number restrained only to twelve? ‘⁶ Y ou twelve,'' that is,
all saints, “shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel‚'' that is,
⁶ the whole world,j is so thorny a gloss, that my fingers can
by no means touch it.

III. XVe gave the sense of the words in their place.
Namely, by ⁶ Christ's sitting in the throne of his glory,⁹ is
not to be understood his tribunal in the last judgment3 but
when he should come in the glory of his vengeance against
the Jewish nation, then not the persons, but the doctrine of
the twelve apostles, should judge and condemn that most
wickcd nation.

And as to the opinion itself concerning tlte saints* sitting
with Christ,

I. Nothing is plainer in the Scripture than that all shall
stand before tho judgmcnt seat of Christ, 2 Cor. v. 10, as well
the sheep as the goats, Matt. xxv. 32, &tu Mention indeed
is made of reiqm'nf] with Christ, but nowhere of y‘zcdqingy with
Christ in the day of judglncnt.

ΙΙ. How little or nothing doth that sound‚ “ T leo saints
shall approve the judgment of Cl1rist!” Are thrones for this
to be set up, that those that sit upon them should approve
the judgment? The very devils and damned themselves shall
not otherwise choosc but acknowledge his justice.
