phyrius quoted by the same Eusebius, worth our taking

these sacrifices of men were abolished almost everywhere
Pallas tells us, who wrote excellently well concerning the mys-
teries of Mithra under Adrian the empcror.”

Καὶ τὸ ἄστρον τοῦ θεοῦ ὑμῶν Ῥεμφάυ· And the star of your

Ῥαιφᾶυ, Bephcm. 1 would not in this place heap up what
learned men have said in this matter: upon these two hinges
the whole difficulty turns; first, to reconcile the Septuagint
with the prophet Amos; and then to reconcile St. Stephen‚
01· St. Luke, with the Septuagint.

Ι. Forasmuch as the IIeb. ’,πῂ Okojmz is Ῥαιφὰυ, Raphon,

in the Septuagint‚ I would not look for any thing fflyantz‘c in
the word Ῥαιφὰυ, Elephan, but something rather wealc and
infirm. Any one knows that ΠΞἽ and ῙἾἾΞἾ signisy wealc and
weakness ,· and from thence perhaps the word Ῥαιφᾶυ, Replum,
may take its original, and not from ΝΞἾ, α fricant. And so
the same thing might be done by the interpreters in this
name that had been done by the Jews in the name of Beel-
zebul, viz. invented the name for mere contempt and reproach.
The naked and native signification of ΥΡΞ, Οῆϋῑιη is firm, up-
risylct, εταόἶες and therefore is rendered by some in that place
basis, or foundation .· a name, indeed, most unfit for an idol,
which is a lie, vanity, nothing. This the Septuagint being
apprehensive of might translate it by a word perfectly con-
trary, but more agreeable to the thing itself3 viz. Ῥαιφᾶν,
Rephan, that is, in Hebrew, ῙἾἛἾ weakness, irqfirmz'ly .· if Ῥαι-
φῖιυ, Replzcm, does not denote ‘ Saturn' in the Coptic lan-
guage, as Kircher tells us.

II. But how Ῥαιφὰυ, Raplccm, should be changed into Ῥεμ-
φὰν, there havc been various, and those not impertinent, con-
jectures. The Syriae and Arabic retain ῑΞἾ and mnas-¹3
which,as to the sense we have mentioned ,sound properly enough
to eastern ears. And what if St. Luke or our martyr, that
they also (as much as might bc) might sound the same thing
in the ears of the Greeks, should pronounce it by Ῥεμφέιυ,
,Ιί6)ὶῑ])]ιαη; where the sound of tho word ῥεμβὸς, which sig-
nifies waimlem'nq or ίοΐτυνῖηῃ, might be included.

Be it therefore that Jloloch is the sun, and Remphan or
