gion, out ofthe synagogue, they went up 1‘5'2'21737‘2' into au, ccpper
room, some uppermost part of the house. “ Abniahd, a very
rich man, invit-ed Rabban J ohanan Ben Zacchai3 and his dis-
cipleS‚ and Nicodemus‚ 810. 10 a feast, which he made at the
circumcision of his son. When the feast was done, Rabban
J ohanan and his disciples went up ..Y-,37:717 into cm ‘topper room„
and read, and expounded, till the fire shone round about them
as when the law was given at mount Sinai. Abniah was amazed
at the honour that was given to the law, and so devoted his
son to the law.'’ 'Pake notice that ΠἯζῒὩ om κιρροὶ· room is
distinet from a diuite-<7 raom, where they dined and supped;
and there it was they handled the law and divine things: to
which if that ἀνώγεομ, ίαν-00 ‘etpper room, mentioned Mark xiv.
15, and Luke xxii. 12, where our Saviour celebrated the Pass-
over, had any affinity, it seems to have been something differ-
ent from a common dining room.

II. Such a kind of ὑπερῷον, 01· tappet· room, I presume, was
the Beth-Mimas of this or that Rabbin. R. Simeone saith,
“ ‘ I saw Πῖἶῖψ ΊΞ the sons of the appar roone, that they were
few in 11111111)01·;’” that 15 (if I take the word ,7479 aright),
tlte sons or disciples of Beth-Midras .· 11111 Ι will not eontend in

:ind many instances of that kind. Of this kind seems that
upper ehamber at Troas, mentioned Acts xx. ὃ. And 50,
where we meet with the ehureh in such or such a one’s house,
it seems to look this way: viz. 501110 upper part of the house,
sequestered on purpose for the assembling of the chureh, in
the same manner that the Betlz-Mz'slras was set apart for the
meeting of the disciples of this 01· that Rabbin. And as the
Beth-Bsidras was always in the house of some Rabbin, so pro—
bably, for the most part, were these ehurehes in the house of
some minister or doctor of the ehureh. &Vas not Aquila such
a one, in whose house we find a chureh mentioned, Rom. xvi.
