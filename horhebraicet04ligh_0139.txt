can by no means understand murder.- πνικτόι), stransylecl„ shall

I. For wherefore should any mention of murder come into
this present controversy? XVere the G-entile converts to be
brought over to Moses, when the moral precepts of Moses
scarcely came in their minds as being the precepts even of
nature itself? But the question isP about ceremonials3 and
what· hath murder to do in that? and, as I have already said,
what need could there be of such peculiar caution against
murder to those who had embraced the gospel of love and
peace ‘f

II. By the prohibition of blood, therefore, I make no ques-
tion but that caution is given against eating of blood ‚· which
is more than once prohibited in the lawq: and there could
hardly any thing except an idol be named that the J ew had
a greater abhorrence for than the eating of bloocl.

The former is forbidden by that, “ Flesh with the life thereof‚
which is the blood thereos, shall you not eat.'' The latter
also is forbidden, “Thou shalt not eat blood let out by the
cutting of a vein, or any other way, fron] any beastss' saith
R. Chaninah in the place above quoted. See also Pasa-ta and
R. Solom0n83 and, instead of more, that passaget : ‘⁵ there-
fore is blood forbidden five times in Scripture? [Gen. ix. 4,
Lev. iii. 17, vii. 26, xvii. 10, Deut. xii. 16.] That the blood
of animals that are holy might be included, and the blood of
animals not holy, and the blood that· was to be covered in the
dust, and the blood ἿἻΠ *EN of tho member of α living] beast,

a. vein or otherwise. God himself adjudgeth him that eats
blood to be cut off, Lev. vii. 27, &c. But as to this matter
there are wondrous nice and subtle questions and distinctions
laid down in Maimonides⁰3 Ι will only transcribe this one:
