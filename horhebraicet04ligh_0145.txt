nor punishment,' &e 'slierefore they departed from the rule
and forsook the law‚'⁷ 8ιο.

⁷ Others¹¹ say otherwise3 “ Antigonus Socheus had two dis-
ciples, who delivered his doctrine to their disciples, and their
disciples again to their disciples3 they stood forth and taught
after them and said, ‘ What did our fathers see that they
should say, It is possible for a labourer to perform all his
work for the whole day, and yet not receive his wages in the
evening3 Surely if our fathers had thought there was another
world, and tlte resurrection of the dead, they would not have
said thus,” διο. “Antigonus Socheus⁰ had two disciples;
their namesp Sadoc and Baithus: he taught them, saying,

From all which compared together, as we find the J ewish
writers varying from one another somewhat in relating this
story, so from the latter passages compared one would be-
lieve that Sadoc was not a &aceldama nor Baithus a Baithu-
sean3 that is, that neither of them was leavened with that
heresy that denied the resurrection, &c There was an occa—
sion taken from the words of AntigonUS, misunderstood and
depraved, to raise such a heresy3 but it was not by Sadoc or
Baithus3 for they “did not understand the sense of them‚”
saith Rambam: and, as it appears out of the Aruclz, they
propounded the naked words to their disciples without any
