Oh. xiv. 2.] Emercitations upon ι Epist. Corinth. 261

II. Public prayers in the synagogue were also made in
HebreW‚ one or two excepted, which were in Chaldee. “ Theyt
were wont to repeat the prayer whose beginning is ξυᾙζ),
after sermon. For the common people were there present
who understood not the holy language. Therefore this prayer
they composed in the Chaldee tongue‚ that all might under-
stand ε’) the rest they understood not.

III. He that taught, or preached out of the chair, spoke
Hebmw, and by an interpreter. “ Theu interpreter stood

before the doctor who preached : ΠἾἻΞΞ] Tim& ‘2³7 ΨΓἸἾῖῬ ΞΞΠ,
and the doctor wlzz'spered Irim in the aar in Hebmw, and he ren-
dered it to the people in the mother tongue.'’ And there in
the Gemara a story is related of Rabh, who was present as
interpreter to R. Shillah: and when R. Shillah said ἾΞἎ ΝἾῙ)
the cocle crows, Rabh rendered it &5351 N'W, when he should

have rendered it ΝΞΞὉᾏΪἾΠ Nus). Hence there is very fre--

While I consider these things used in the synagogues of
the Jews, and remember that a great part of the church of
Corinth consisted of J ews; I cannot but suspect that their
ministers also used the same tongue according to the old
custom; namely, that one read the Scripture out of the He—
brew text, another prayed or preached in the Hebrew lan-
guage X, according to the custom used in the synagogueS.
Which thing, indeed, the apostle allowed, so there were an
interpreter, as was done in the synagogues: because that lan-
guage, fun of mysterieS, being rendered by a fit interpreter,
might very much conduce to the edification of the church.

Ι suspect also that they Judaized in the confused mixture
of their voices ; which seems to be done by them because the
apostle admonisheth them to speak by turm, ver. 27, and not
together. Now from whence they might fetch that con-
fusedness, judge from these passages: “They Rabbins de-
liver. In the law one readS, and one interprete 3 and let not
one read and two interpret. But in the prophets one reads,
and two interpret. But let not two read and two interpret.
