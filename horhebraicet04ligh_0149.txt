let me render it here rather than the resurrection of tlae dead.
And the reason of it we may judge from that one argument
which they bring2‚ instead of many others3 viz. “ Some (10
say that it is proved out of 11116 Scripture. He saith unto
them, ‘ But ye that did cleave 111110 1116 Lord your Orod

05³3! 0:³²¹? ΞἿἼΓ] are alive every one of you this day? Deut.

iv. 4. ΞῬΠ &31:5⁶0 ΒἿἾΠἻ &term It is plain {leat you are
now alive, when Moses speaks these things; but he means
this, that in the day wherein all the world is dead ye shall
live :³³ that 16, “ Ye also, though dead, shall live ;'’ which
rather speaks out the immortality of the 60111 after death
than the resurrection of the body. So our Saviour’s answer
to the Saddncees, Matt. xxii. 31, 32, from those words, “I am ²¹
the God of Abraham,'' 816. 16 fitted directly to consute their
opinion against the immortality of the soul; but it little, either
plainly or directly, so proves the resurrection of the body, but
that the Sadd‘zwees might cavil at that way of proos.

And in that saying of the Sadd‘zwees themselves, concerning
the labourer working all the day and 1101 receiving his wages
at night, there is a plain intimation that they especially con-
sidered of the state of the 60111 after death, and the non-re-
surrection of the body by consequence. Let the words there-
fore be taken in this sense; ‘⁶ The ,sadduceos say, ‘ Souls are
1101 immortal, and that there are neither angele nor spirits ς’ ”
and then the twofold branch which our sacred historian speaks
of will the more clearly appear when he saith, “ But the Pha-
risees confess both.”

lt is doubtful from the words of ,Iosephusb whether the
Essenes acknowledge the resurrection of the body, when in the
mean time they did most heartily own the immortality of the
soul: Καὶ γὰρ ἔρρωται παρ’ αὐτοῖς ἥδε ἡ δόξα, φθαρτὰ μὲν εἶναι
τὰ σώματα, καὶ τὴν ὕλην οὐ μόνιμον αὐτοῖς, τὰς δὲ ψυχὰς ἀθανά-
τους ἀεὶ διαμένειν· This opinion prevails amon-ost them, that the
body indeed is corruptible, aad the matter of it dom not (induro,-
but 30qu andare for ever immortcd. So that the question chiefly
is concerned about the soul's immortality.

Μηδὲ ἄγγελοι) μήτε πνεῦμα· Neitlcer anyel, nor spirita] They
deny that the soul is immortal, and they deny any spirits, (in
