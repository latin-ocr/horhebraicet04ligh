Jonathan. And why were not the Targumists themselves
read rather, and the business done by fewer? Because the
original text is by no means to be neglected. And why the
Hellenists should be 000101· 111 this business than the Hebrews,
who can give a reason ἓ

Therefore, how much the more zeal and honour they had
sor the Hebrew text, so much the less grateful to them was
the version of it into another tongue. For they thought so
much of honour, virtue, and worth departed from the hely
text, as that language or those very letters were departed

without all scruple, that if they are wrote 111 Hebrew, they
ought to be snatehed 0ut3 but if in another language, or 111
other characters, then it is doubted. Y ea, R. Jose saith,
“ They are not to be snatehed out.'''
