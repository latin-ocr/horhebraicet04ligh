beians, and persons of no name, or such who could not derive
their genealogy‚ as ver. 62, or perhaps not a few of them were
of the ten tribes.

Butm how great a multitude of Jews yet remained iu Ba-
bylon, when that number went back to their ancient country,
you may conjecture by these two things, to omit others :

Ι. That of the four-and-twenty courses of the priests there
returned only four, as the Jerusalem Talmudists¹¹ observo,
and that well, out of Ezra ii. 36. And although you may
conceive a less proportion by far in the rest of the people, yet
the number of those that tarried behind did far exceed the
number of those that returned.

II. The people had taken root in Babylon, and the seventy
years of the captivity had, in a manner, made them forget
their own country. They had been commanded of God to
build themselves houses, to plant gal-(lens. and to compose
themselves for a long continuanee in that place; Jer. xxix.
5, 6 : and at length necessity passed into pleasure, and having
obtained quiet, commodious‚ and gainful seatS, they judged it,
better to be there than to return into an umnanured [incultam]
country, full of danger and want.

Hence the masters dispute, VVhether that whole company
that went up with Ezra went not up by compulsion: and

master thinks, that in separatim they separated themselves, and vo-

luntarily went up. Another master, ἾΠΠῬἾΟΝ wirma: ‘73⁹2
that they were carried away by compulsion.'’ For as the
Gloss speaks, ‘⁶ They that remained atv Babylon enjoyed their
quiet; but those that went up to Jerusalem were pressed with
poverty, and with all kind of labour and sear, by reason of
those that dwelt about then1.''

Concerning those that tarried behind, the Jews themselves
have these words :

Ι. That a purer blood of Jews remained in Babylon than
was of those that went up Ρ. Because that “ Ezra carried
away with him the dregs of the people, and left Babylon like
pure fleur :³² that is, as the Gloss writes, “ All that were of
impure blood he carried away thence with himf' Hence is
