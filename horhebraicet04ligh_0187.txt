Ch. v. i, 2.] Emer-citamus upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 181

A bitter taunt! chastising the boasting of the Corinthiam,
who had forgot from whom they had first received those evan-
gelical privileges concerning which they now prided them-
selves. They were enriched with spiritual gifts3 they reigned,
themselves being judgeS‚ in the very top of the dignity and
happiness of the gospel5 and that ‘¹ without us, saith the apo-
stle, as though ye owed nothing to us for those privileges :'’
and ⁴⁸0, would to God ye did reign? and that it went so
happily and well with you indeed, that we also might reign
with you, and that we might partake of some happiness in this
your promotion, and might be of some account among you .⁸

And who is he that suffered the wrong? The father, without
doubt; now certainly alive, and not deceased3 for it would
scarcely have been said of him if dead, that he suffered wrong
by this wicked action.

Ver. 2 ε Καὶ ὑμεῖς πεφυσιωμένοι ἐστέ· And μ’ are ngffed up]
It is a wonder indeed that they mourned not; but it is inore
wonderful that they should be plqffed up and glory in such a
wickedness as is shown at ver. 6. But whence proceeded so
foolish and wicked a boasting3

I. Perhaps from the affectation of a party, and the bitter-
ness of their contentions‚ the adverse party triumphing against
that party in which happened so grievous a fall.

II. Perhapsa, by an ill conceit of the liberty of the gospel,
they triumphed in this thing, as though the gospel had brought
in such a liberty against the law.

Ill. Or it may seem that the father of the incestuous
person was not a Christian, but either a heathen or an un-
