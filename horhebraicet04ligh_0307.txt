that ΠὊἾἾ mh: they transeribed sin Greek, that is, they
turned, as the word which followeth tumn-1³7 to imm-pret,
sufficiently explains. But of the Seventy there is no such
thing: but only this, ΠὮΞΣἯ ἾΞΞΞ ΠἼἾΠ ἾΞἹΠΞΚΠ “ that they
transm-ibai the law by itseff, and changed thirteen places
in it.''

There is a passage indeed where the Babylonian Talmudists
are brought in with their relation, whereby one might think
that they intimated that the Seventy translated into Greek.
⁶⁶ Our masters (say they k) permittes] not that the Holy Books
should be transcribed but into Greek. And it is a tradition.
R. J udah saith, WVhen they permitted to transcribe in Greek,
they permitted it of the Book of the Law only3 ΞἾΨΌἾ

ἾῖἬΞΠ *telvm-1 ΠΨΞΠΞ ancl that because of that which happened
to kiozy Ptolemgy:’' or let it be as it is rendered by some,
Wloence tlae work· ‘was beaten with Ptolemy the hius).

But if any should say that they trau-wribed, indeed, in
Greek, that is, the Hebrew text in Greek letters, and trems-
lated not, you would scarcely refute him out of the Talmud-
ists3 especially when elsewhere they distinguish between

writing out '‘WJZD ³732 in any laozyzsaqal, that is, in the cha-

racters of any language; and writing out ῑἿὶζῗῖῖ ³⁰52: &uun
bg( a version into angl langyaafye: and when there was a publi-
cation and edition of a double Hebrew text in Origen's Hex-
apla and Oetapla m, δι’ Ἑβραϊκῶν καὶ Ἑλληνικῶν στοιχείων, in
Hebrew ancl Greek characters, he seems not to have been with-
out his copy, in which the Hebrewtext itself was written out
in Greek letters.

What at length does that mean, They wrote out the law by
itself? Certainly either this, They transcribed the law only,
and not the other books3 or rather, They transcribed the
Hebrew law itself in Hebrew, and turned it not.

‘⁶ They wrote out (say they) the law by itself, and changed
thirteen places in it.'' The examination of the latter clause
will yield light to the former, and will give its vote to him
that says, That it does not appear in the Talmudists that the
LXX translated at all, but that they only transcribed the
Hebrew books in Hebrew.
