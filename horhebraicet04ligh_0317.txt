and religion of the whole uaticn, than by turning their holy
books into the Greek language, that all might know what it
was that they professed. They could not but 800 but those
books would at last, though they were never so unwilling,
come forth 111 the vulgar languagc; nor could they hinder
but they would everywhere happen into the hands of the hea-
