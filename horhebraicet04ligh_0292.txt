ADDENDA TO CHAP.X1V.‹³

'rhat some light may be added to what we spake at chap. xiv, about the
use of aa unknown touque, we thought it not arniss to make a brief dis-
course for the (liscussing that question, What Biblos were commonly used
in the reliyiozzs meetinqs of the Jews ,9 which discourse we have laid here,
that the continuation of the commentary might not be broken.

OHAP. Ι.

Concerniozy the Hebrews aad Hellenists.

WHEN the Hellen'z'sts and Hebrews are distinguished, Acts
vi. 1, it seems to be less obscure than when distinction is
made between the Hellenists and the Jews, Acts xi. 20: for
that the Hellem‘sts were Jews almost all agree.

The reason of the distinction may be fetched either from
their dispersion or from their language. Διασπορςὶ τῶν Ἑλ-
λήνων, the dispersim of the Greeks, John vii. 35, may be plainly
distinguished ἀπὸ τῆς διασπορᾶς τῶν Βαβυλωνίων, from the dis-
persion of {lie Babyloniam& The Jews dispersed by the vieto-
ries and colonies of the Greeks, from the Jews dispersed by
the Babylonian eaptivity and the Persian dominion.

But the differenee is rather fetehed from their language;
they being called Hebrews to whom the Hebrew was the
mother-tongue, that is, the Syriae 01· Chaldee3 they Hellem‘sts
to whom the Greek language was so.

Under the name of Hebrews, there is none but would place
the Palestinaeans‚ the Babylonians, the Assyrians, the Syrians,
if they knew what was the common mother-tongue of all these
eountries; especially if they that knew all these countries
were placed by the Talmudists themselves, in effect, under the
same rank and alliance of customs and privileges, as well as
under the same language. Henee are these and such like
expressions to be met with in them :

‘⁶ Whosoeverc dwells in Babylon is as though he dwelt in
the land of Israel.’' “ Alls foreign land is called D'W ΓῸἾἾῃ
Ῐιθαίῖιεη, exeept Babylon.’' KVhere by ⁴722 Babylon they
understand all those eountries unte which the Babylonian
captivity was carried and led away.
