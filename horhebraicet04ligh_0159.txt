Ch. xxviii. 15.] Eoeeroe'tations upon tlte Acts. 153

St.Paul and the rest abide at Puteoli seven days at the en-
treaty of the Christiane of that place: which redounded to the
eredit of the centurion, whose leave must be obtained in that
ease: so that- his yielding so far may somewhat argue that he
favoured Christianity.

Ver. 15: Ἐξῆλθον εἷς ἀπάντησιν ἡμῖν ἄχρις Ἀππίου Φόρου
καὶ Τριῶν Ταβερνῶν· They] came to meet us as fiacr as Appii
forum and le three taverna] ‘V ia Appia’ and Appz‘iforum
are much spoke of in authors3 but the mention of Tlae three
taverws is not so frequent. There is mention in Zosimusl of
Τρία καπηλεῖα, i. e. The three victualliny-houses; where Severus
the emperor was strangled by the treason of Maximianus Her-
culius and Maxentius his son.
