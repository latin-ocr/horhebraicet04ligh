Chrjmo should be Saturn ; we read of the introduction of Mo-
loch into the land of Israel, but of Olmtjzm not at all, only in
the prophet Amos, and here in the mention of Remplzcm.

XVhen I read that in Ι Kings xii. 30, ‘⁶ That all the people
went to worship the calf in Dan,” and observe further that
Dan was called Panias‚ I begin to think that Φὰυ, Pham, in
Ῥαιφᾶυ, Raphana, and Ῥεμφὰυ, Rempkan, may have some re-
lation with that name ; and that Dan is mentioned rather
than Bethel, becauseo the idolatry or oalf of that place con-

indeed to the same letters, but make the variat-ion by the
change of vowel-s. Which shews, in the mean time, that
this was neither any strange thing amongst them, nor ac-
counted any crime; but received rather with applause, to
alienate the words of the Hebrew text from their native
and original reading, to deduce something either true in it-
self, or at least smooth and ingenious. And if Stephen here,
after the usage of the 80110018, quoting this passage of the
