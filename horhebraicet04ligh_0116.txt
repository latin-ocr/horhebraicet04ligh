Herod himself, Mark vi. 20.

As to the remaining part of the story, the Talmudistsk add
this passage3 “³an 0:225 ’.ΞΠΠὩ &3¹⁸ Meneclem went ο-ιιτ,
and Sleammai entered. But whither went Mcnahem? Abai

of wickeclness. Aba saith, ‘ He went into the serviccl of the
king, and with him went fourscore pair of disciplcs, all clad in
silk) '’ I dare not say this Menahem was the same with our
Manaen, unless he were a hundred years of age, or tliereabout 3
and yet, when I observe the familiarity that was between that
Menahem and Herod the father, and how oure was brought
up with Herod the son (which certainly was not put in by our
historian for no reason), it cannot but give me some appre-
hension that either he might be the person himself, or rather
his son (if at least that Essenos had children) 3 or, in a word,
some very near relation. Be it one or other, it is worthy in-
duiry, whether this our Manaen might not lay the foundation
of his evangelical religion in the court of Herod the tetrarch‚
when John Baptist preached there.

II. Perhaps it might be somewhat bold to say, that the
church at Antioch did according to the Jewish custom ob-
serve the weekly fasts3 and yet more bold to say that church
chose those days for fasting which the Jews had done, viZ. the
second and fifth days of the week: but it would be most au-
dacious to conjecture that they observed the ›Jewish sabbathm
in some measure with the Lord's day, and that with fasting,
when as the Jews would by no means endure a fast upon that
day. But whatever the day of this fasting was, or what occa-
