Oh, xvi. 8, &c.] Emercimtz‘ous upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 275)

that he would not also salute them in the name of the churches
of Macedonia.

II. It appears that he wrote this Epistle before he came
into Macedonia, from what he saith in the Second Epistle,
chap. ii. 12, 13, and vii. 5—7. For when he met not Titus at
Troas, whom together with Stephanas‚ Fortunatus, and
Achaicus, he had sent to Corinth with this Epistle, 1101· as
yet could know what fruit it had gained among the Corinth-
ians, he hastened a journey into Macedonia. And when he
came thither and found not Titus there, he stayed for some
time with an unquiet mind, until Titus at last came, the mes-
senger of good news.

” ΠΙ. Η6 saith, ver. 8, ἐπιμευῶ δὲ ἐν Ἐφέσῳ· Ι shall tat-ry in
Ephesus: as if he would say, “ Here at Ephesus, where now
I am, I shall remain until Pentecost.’'

Ver. 8 : Ἐπιμευῶ δὲ ἐν Ἐφέσῳ· But I will tarry at Ephesus]
XVhether he tarried at Ephesus until the time determined by
him, [that is, Pentecost,] or the uproar of Demetrius drove
him away thence sooner, is uncertain. Being driven thence,
Macedonia received him,as is related, Acts xx: where although
among his travels there is no mention of his journey to Co-
rinth, yet thither he travelled, while his companions went
before to Troas, and expected him there.

Ver. 9: Θύρα γάρ μοι ἀνέῳγε, &c. For a door is opened {0
me, &off See Acts xix. 17—20.

Ver. 10: Ἐὰν δὲ ἔλθῃ Τιμόθεος· But ff Timothy coma]
This place deceived him again who added the ὑπογραφὴ, the
underwritiny, to this Epistle: in whose fancy Timothy was
sent with Stephanae, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, to bring the
Epistle to the Corinthians: by no light mistake3 for Timothy
indeed was sent, but from Ephesus into Macedonia with
Erastus, Acts xix. 22, to see the Corinthians in his return,
but not at all sent thither out of Macedonia by the order of
the apostle, which he dreams of. ·

Ver. 19: ’Σὺν τῇ κατ’ οἶκοι) αὐτῶν ἐκκλησίᾳ· With the churclz
that is in their house] So also it is said of them when they
were come back from Rome, that they had a church in their
house, Rom. xvi. 5. And the same is said of Philemon, Phi-
lem. ver. 2, and see Col. iv. 15. But in what- sense to under-
stand this is somewhat obscure.
