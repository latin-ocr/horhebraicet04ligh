zarites let their hair grow, and that by divine command? I
answer, It was a sign of humiliation and sels-deniaL as ab·
staining from wine and grapes also was. It made a show of
a certain religious slovenlincss, and contempt of a man’s self.

They are therefore very much deceived who think that
Absalom let his hair grow out of pride, when he did so, in-
deed, by reason of a vow (at least a seigned vow) of Nazarite-
ship. The Jerusalem Talmudists say very truly; ΞἸῖἎίῚΞΝ
ΠἾΠ ΞῖῒἭ) ἻἾΞ Absalom (say theye) was a perpetual Naza-
rite. Very tmly, I say, in this, that they assert he was a
Nazarite: but of the perpetuity of his vow we will not here
dispute. See 2 Sam. xv. 7, 8.

There is in Tacitus a wicked votary not unlike him, Civi-
lis by name, of whom thus he speaks3 “ Civilisf‚ barbaro
voto, post coepta adversus Romanos arma, propexum rutila-
tumque crinem, patrata demum caede legionum deposuit.”
Civilis, by α barbarous vom, after arms taken up ayainst the
Romans, laid down lais lons] red hair, the slauyhter of the leffl’ons
being] at last eoeecuted. ·

The Jews, if they were 1101 bound by the vow of a Nazarite‚
cut their hair very often3 and however they did it at other
times, certainly always before a feast, and that in honour of
the feast that was approaching. W hence a greater suspicion
may here amiso, that these Corinthians, by their long hair,
professed themselves Nazarites.

“ These g cut their hair in the feasth itself z he that comes
from a heathen place, and he that comes out of prison, and
the excommunicate person who is loosed from his excommu-
nication.” The sense of the tradition is this; ‘¹ Those who
were detained by some necessity before the feast, that they
could not cut their hair, might cut it in the feast itself: but
if no such necessity hindered, they cut their hair before the
feast, and commonly on the very eves of the feast. “ Wheni
any man cuts 1101 his hair on 1110 eves of the festival (lay, but
three days before, it appears that he cut not his hair in
honour of the feast.''

We cannot here omit this story: “ Al< certain traveller,
