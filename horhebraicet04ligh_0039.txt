that time, viz. “ These words, ⁸ my flesh shall restjn hope‚’

insece had any power over Davedf‚· then was 11 agreeable
enough that St.. Peter should by way of preface crave the
leave of his auditory in speaking of David's being putrified
in the grave⁷ and so the word ἐξὸν 18 well rendered, let me.
But I may pleaseth me best, and by this paraphrase the
words may be illustrated; “That this passage, ‘Thou shalt not
leave my 80111 111 11011] &a is not 10 be applied 10 David himself,
appears in that I may confidently aver concerning him, that
he was dead and buried, and never rose again, but his seul
was left εἰς ᾅδου, in the state of {lae dead, and he saw corrup-
tion: for his sepulchre is with us unte this day, under that
very 11011011, 111111 11 18 1110 sepulchre of David, who died, and
was there buried3 nor is there one syllable any where 111011-
tioned of the resurrection of his body, or the return of his
soul ἐξ ᾅδου, from tlze state of the dead.”

I cannot slip over that passage g, “ R. J ose Ben R. Ben saith
nawa Πῖὶ ἻἾἻ David died at Pentecost; and all Israel be-
wailed him, and offered their sacrifices the day following.”
