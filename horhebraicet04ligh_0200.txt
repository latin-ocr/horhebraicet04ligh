before μὴ συναναμίγνυσθαι, not το company with them : now he
writes μὴ συνεσθίειν, not to eat with them.

II. It is plain also that he ainis his words at profane
Christians, not at heathens, both now and when he writ
before. For there wcre among the Christians converted from
heathenisni some, without doubt, whose parentS, 01· children,
or kinsmen, not yet converted‚ wallowed in idolatry‚ covetous-
ness, and whoredoms. But now a Christian was not to forget
all these alliances; nor was all familiarity and respect towards
them to be cast away.

ΙΙΙ. “ The word συναναμίγνυσθαι denoteS, saith Camerarius,
necessitudinem aliquam interiorem, some more intimate friend-
ship, or alliances: which indeed in 801110 respect is true, if
that onore inwarcl fin'endslcz’p be distinguished into that which
is more close and less close. Συνανάμιξις is to be reckoned
that conversation anclfiriendslap which a J ew might enter into
with a J ew, and not with a heathen: according to the rule of
which, as being very well known, it scarcely can be doubted
but the apostle speaks.

Ι. Α J ew might deal and traffick with a heathen never-
theless, under this and some other cautions of that nature:

vals of the keatlaens, it is forbidden to give and receive with them,
to lend to or to borrow of them, to restore or to fetch back
any thing,'' &a I scarcely believe⁶ this falls under the signi-
fication of the word συναναμίγνυσθαι, eompanyiny.

ΙΙ. To eat together and at one table was συναναμίγνυσθαι,
lo company, which certainly appears enough from the strait
prohibition of such eating with a heathen. A pharisee, in
markets and faiis, would have dealing with a common person;
but he would not eat with him. So a common person would
trade with a heathen ; but he would not eat with him. The
apostle therefore does not oppose συναναμίγνυσθαι, company-
iny, and συνεσθίειν, eatinq castellion, one against another, but
propounds calin-a toffez‘her as a certain degree συναναμίξεως, of
companyiny or mirina tossets'cer. For,

observed, a much more inward fricndship than such a bare
eating, nainely, that which is called by the Jews“ lawyers
