from the Jews, when we see it only distinguisheth from the
Hebrews.

2. St. Luke calls Nicolas ‘a proselyte of Antioch‚’ ver. 5.
would we therefore call him Ἐλληνιστὴν Ἀντιοχέα, a Helle-
m'st of Antioch ,9 we would rat-her term him, ”Ελληυα, α Greek,
because his very name shows him to have been originally
a Greek.

3. As to that distinction in chap. xi. 19, 20, (for I would
rather term it a distinction than an antithesis,) it doth not
conclude the Hellenists not to have been J eWS, but intimates
the difference only between Jews of a more pure and worthy
rank, and Jews not so pure and worthy.

II. There are those that think, and that truly, that the
Hellenists were ‘Jews dispersed amongst the Gentiles3' but
that they were called Hellenists for this reason especially, viz.
because they used the Greek Bible in their synagogues:
which whether it be true or not I question, but will not dispute
it at this present; only thus far Ι will observe:

1. That the Greek tongue was in mean esteem amongst
the Jews; indeed they hated it rather than took any pleasure
in it, or had any value for it. Wheni Aristobulus the Asmo-
nean besieged his brother Hyrcanus, and some things had
fallen out amiss with them, through the counsel of a certain
old man skilled in the Greek learning, “they said at that
time, ‘Cursed be the man that cherisheth swine,' and, ‘Cursed
the man that teacheth his son the wisdom of the Gl‘eeks.'

and would have the war of Titus the same with that of Ari-
stobulus and Hyrcanus3 but the Gloss upon the former place
rightly distinguisheth, and grants there was such a decree
made in the days of the Asmoneans‚ but having been ne-
glected‚ in process of time was revived and renewed in the
war with Titus. Let it be one or the other, we may abun-
dantly see what kind of respect the Greek learning or lan-
guage had amongst them. For this passage follows in both z
