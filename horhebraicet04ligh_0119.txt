the same kind of outrages, thet leader (of tlte C'gspriots) being
Artemi0n3 where two hundred and forty thousand men were
lost: whence it came to pass that a J ew might not come into
Cyprus. But if by chance and stress of weather he put in
upon the island, he was killed. But the Jews, as by others,

dition‚ were all subdued.⁷'

Ver.6: Ἷὶι ὀύομα Βαρϊησοῦς· lVltose name was .B(lr77⁰esus.
Vel‘.8: Ἐλύμας ὁ μάγος· οὕτω γὰρ μεθερμηνεύεται τὸ ὄνομα
αὐτοῦ· Elymas the sorcerer (sor so is his name by interpreta-
tion).] Ι. It may be inquired whether Ἰησοῦς, Jesus, in Bap-
ϊησοῦς, Bar-jesus, be a proper name or an appellative. In the
Arabio in the Polyglot Bible it is writ as a proper name
9712* Jesu; but in the Arabic of the Erpenian edition it is
writ as an appellative :³wa Jesus: and under the same
notion, the Syriae, taking the word for Bar-jesus, hath '11
&miv Bar-Shumalt, the son of a name, as Beza would have it:
but trulier, the 8072 cf a s'eoellin‘o, or α womzd: for NDWID
and &7250 is a memor or pustula, in the Targumists of Jonathan
and of Jerusalem, upon Levit. xiii. 23 and in the Syriae, it is
NDD'RU- So also ΠἾτηᾏτ-ξ a wozmd is by that translated

ΝΠὯἾΨ, Isa. i. 6. liii. 5. And indeed Elymas can no way
be the interpretation of Bar-ybsus, if Jeszcs here be a proper
name, and especially if it must be writ yWJ'.

II. I would therefore write Bar-,Iesus in Hebrexv letters

thus, mimz„ ’11 a word derived from &my which signifies
⁵ to waste away, or ba corroded and worn by a disease. So
Psal. vi. 8. xxi. 10. ’3)ᾆῖ ῠὲἒζ) :7me mine eye z's consumed,
or, as the Intedinear, eorrocled, because oj'yriqf. And that the
Syriae had reference to this radix when he renders it by
&Dum Ἶζὶ the son of α womzd, or a ewelliny, proceeding from a·
disease‚ is little to be doubted ; and with this etymology the
word Elymas agrees excellently well.

III. There are those that would have it to be the inter-
pretation of the word μάγος; that is, that the Arabic word
&Dfflvy [Alz'ma], and so Elymas, 16 the same with μάγος, α
sorcerer5 which does not seem very distant from truth. Once
indeed such a conceit pleased me well enougln but since,
these two things, well considered, have led me another way :-—
