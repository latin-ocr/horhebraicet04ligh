Ch. vi. 4.] Evercltations upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 201

the charde] 1. ΤΟ interpret this word* here for those that
are most vile, or most contemptible, which some versions do, is
certainly somewhat hard and improper. What! needy per-
sons, and 811611 as seek their living by allus or hard labour, to
make tlmm judgesl W hence should such have skill to judge‚
or be at leisure for it? How apt might they be to consult
rather their own gain than just jndgment? And who would
not despise such judges? The word therefore, ἐξουθενημένους,
