Oh. ix] Addenda to 1 Cor. xiv. 307

Ι. Ini Gen. ii. 2, the Greek words are, Συι·ετε’λεσεν ὁ Θεὸς
ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἕκτῃ· And Godfihished on the sioeth ⁰⁷03!- VVas
it to that very sense in the copy which the interpreters used}
‘⁴ They changed, and wrote, say the Gemarists, DT'Z ³3³2*
'³me He finished in the sioeth day.” The Gloss writes,
“ That it might not be said that God did any thing on the
sabbath.” In their Hebrew copy it was as it is in ours,
’ᾨᾞῖζ-«Ἦ 1:5³3, ³727} ‘⁶ And God ended his work οη the seventh

day .·”’ but they changed it in the Hebrew transcript whereof
we spake, and so did the interpreteris in the Greek version.

II. In Exod. xii. 40, the Greek words are, ‘H δὲ κατοίκησις
τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ, ἣν κατῴκησαν ἐν γῇ Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ ἐν γῇ Χαναάν,
&c. Now the sqjournihq of the children of Israel, which they
sojournecl in the land of Egypt, (md in Canaan,'<8·c. Did the
interpreters read so in their Hebrew copy? No. “They
changed (say the Talmudists), and writ, ΫἻΝΞἾ ΕἺἾΞὩ ῩἾΝΞ.
ῙὩΞΞ In the land onyypt, and in the lcmd of C'cmaan.” In
the copy which was in their hands, those words 3372: ῩἾΝΞἸ
in the land of Canama, were absent: but they added it of
their own. The Gloss saith, ‘⁴ Lest it should be said, A lie
is written in your law: for behold, Kohath was among those
that went down into Egypt. And if you reckon all the years
of Kohath, Amram, and Moses, they amount not to four
hundred.”

ΙΙΙ, In Numb. xvi. 15, the Greek words are, Οὐκ ἐπιθύμημα
οὐδενὸς αὐτῶν εἴληφα· Ι have not taken the desire of cmy of
them. W'as '17:07 desire, written in the copy used of the
Seventy? No. It is an alteration, say the masters; sor it
was written ἻὩΠ an ass, and they transferred it into Ἲ72Π
desire. The Gloss writes, “ That it might not be said, Per-
haps he took not an ass, but he took away some other desir-
able thin9.” And you may know the lion by his paw.

Let these things be spoken to prove that it is not so hete-
rodox to suppose that the Greek version was not read in the
synagogues of the Hellffliists, but the Hebrew text, so as it
was in the synagogues of the Hebrews. And now let us
briefly weigh what things are said on the contrary side.
