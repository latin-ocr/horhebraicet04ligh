Ch. xiii. 16, Sec] Exercitations upon the A crs. 117

in the Greek tongue‚ were they understood by those in Pisidia?
Yes, you will say; for the very name of the city Antioch
speaks it to have been a Greek colony. Gsrant this: but then
suppose a Jewish synagogue in some city of Pisidia that was
purely Pisidian, such as Selge, SagaleSSUS‚ Pernelissus, δια, οι·
in some city of the Solymites or of the Lydizms, in what
language was the law read there? Doubtless in the same
tonguee and the same manner that it was read in the syna-
gogue of the Hebrews, i. e. in the original Hebrew, some
interpeter assisting‚ and rendering it to them in their mother-
tongue.

Ver. 16: Οἱ φοβούμευοι τὸν Θεόυ· And yse that sear [ἰωή]
That is, proselytes. '·‘ ‘ Blessed is every one that feareth the
Lord, that walketh in his ways,' Psalm cxxviii. Ι. He doth
not say, Blessed is Israel, or Blessed are the priests. or
Blessed the Levites; but Blessed is every one that feareth
the Lord, ’Π ’δῖἾἽ ΞΠΨ [Fu WLJQQ These are tlm proselytae,
the φοβούμενοι τὸν Θεὸυ, they tlcat ferm· tlte Lord. According
as it is said of Israel, ⁸ Blessed art thou, Ο lsrael,’ so is it
said of these, ⁶ Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord.’
Now of what proselyte is it said that he is blessed3 It is said
of the proselyte of justice. Not as those Cuthites, of whom it
is said, that ‘' they feared the Lord, and yet worshipped their
own godsf.'” ⁷

Ver. 18: Ἐτροποφόρησεν αὐτούς· He szffirecl their manners]
The particle ὣς seems to exclude the reading of ἐτροποφόρησεν,
which word we meet with in the Seventy, Deut. i. 31 3 ἐτροπο-
φόρησε, God did indeed bear with them full forty years: and
so you will say, ἐτροποφόρησεν αὐτοὺς is not wide from the
truth. But the apostle adding the particle ὣς, about the tima
(gf forty years7 seems chiefly to respect that time which went
between the fatal decree that they should not enter the land,
and the going in.

Ver. 19: Ἕθυη ἑπτά· Seven- natione] The Rabbins very
frequently, when they mention the Canaanitish people, give
them this very term of the seven natiofns, ΠἾὩἾΝ Πζυὶω.
