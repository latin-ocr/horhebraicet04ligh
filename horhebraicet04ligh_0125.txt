three years of the tyrants make the number to exeeed in this
place.

III. In the particular summing up of these years, l cannot
omit what is said coneerning Samson in the J ewish writersk :
‘⁶ Samson saith, ‘ O Lord eternal, give me a recompenso for
one of mine eyes in this world, and for the other in the world
to come? One place saith, 0⁸32}ssss LDNQiDss‘Nss Yfflfflffl]
Πέἱζ] And lie judqed Israel forty years. Another place saith,
‚7322 13⁸5in ἓᾷἶίυἻ-Πζή ωὲζὲ &Hs—i] And lte jzcdyed Israel
twenty years. R. Aelia saith, ‘ By this it is hinted, that the
Philistines were afraid of him twenty years after his death,
as they had stood in sear of him twenty years while he was
alive.' '⁵

From these words we might imagine that it was written
concerning Samson, that he judged lsrael forty years; which
yet is nowhere found: only it is said in two places, Judg. xv.
20, xvi. 31, that ‘⁶ he judged twenty years :'’ whence the
J ewish writers draw that conclusion as was said before, viz.
that the Philistines were under the terror of him for the space
of twenty years after he had been dead. Indeed, it is said of
Eli, that ‘² he judged Israel forty years‚” 1 Sam. iv. 18: which
when Ι observe the LXX rendering by εἴκοσι ἔτη, ‘twenty'
years, I cannot but suspect they might somewhat favour the
received opinion amongst the Jews.

Ver. 33: Ἐν τῷ ψαλμῷ τῷ δευτέρῳ· In the second psalm]
“ Whyl are the daily prayers to the number of eighteen ’Ξ R.
J oshua Ben Levi saith, ⁶ It is according to the eighteen psalms,
from the beginning of the psalms to Tlce Lorcl leem thee ’ἶφι
the day of trouble [Psalm xx. 1.]. But if any one say to thee.
‘They a1=e11ineteen‚' 'prm seiri we ium :72³7 ’πῖ-1 was
say thou to Irim, ‘ Why do the heatlcen raye? [i. e. the second
psalm] is not one of them? Hence they say, ‘ He that prays
and is not heard, it is necessary for him to fast too? '²

l. Judge hence whether this second psalm were joined or
confounded with the first, when it seems in some measure
sequestered from the whole number. And do you observo
the Rabbins’ way of arguing‘? Being to prove that the num-
ber of the daily prayers being eighteen was adapted to flu·
