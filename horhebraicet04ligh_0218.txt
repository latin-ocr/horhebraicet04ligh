You see at first sight what that expression in lzoliness means.
An offspring born out of lcolz'ness was an offspring born while the
parents were yet heathens; within koliness, when they were
now made proselytos. In the same sense the apostle3 ‘⁶ Your
children are born in holiness, that is, within Christianity, if
either father or mother be Christian : and the children them-
selves are hely, that is, Christians.”

The heathens were reckoned by the Jews for unclean; and
so unclean indeed, that they could not contract uncleanness,
no, not from the most unelean thing, a sepulchrex. Hence
’ heathen children were to them ἀκάθαρτα, undem, and the
children of Jews ἅγια, leoly. To which sense, very well known
to the nation, the apostle alludes in these words.

Ver. 18: Μὴ ἐπισπάσθω· Let him not become uncircumcised]
In Talmudic language‚ 'urb-³37 ἿῈΗῺἾ ³724, let him not draw
his foreskin. “ Lety circumcision be four οι· five times re-
peated, if any one be so often 'sium ἐπισπασθεὶς, drawn, mz-
circumcised.” Again, “Therez were many in the days of
Ben Oozba, 015³va immin wlco Ιιαιί drawn over the foreskin,
that were again circuincised.'' Anda, ἾἾἚ ἾἾΨΌ ΝἾΠ
tymi-9 ‘⁶ A tradition. He whose foreskz'n is drawn over is to be
circumcised αῃαὶη. The interpretation of the word *mvn
(ἐπισπασθεὶς, drawn) is this3 If, after he had been circum-
cised, the foreskin is drawn over, either by men, or by some
sickness. There were many in the days of Ben Oozba who
had been circumcised, mma ΞΌΨὮΨ whose foreslcin they

vassed, and reigned two years and a half. And they were
circumcised again in his days.'’
