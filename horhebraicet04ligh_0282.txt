dejected. He went home with a sad countenance. His wife
said to him, ‘ thy doth thy countenance languish ἓ) He an-
swered, ⁴ The Rabbins are come, and I know not what to do.'
She said to him, ‘ You have one field left ς go and sell half of
it, and give to them.5 Which he did. And when they were
departed he went to plough in the half of his field, and found
a great treasure,'’ &c. Ι produce this the more willingly,
that it may be observed that collectionis were made among
the Jews in foreign nations for the poor Rabbins dwelling in
J udea. in the sanie manner as they were made among Christ-
ians in foreign nations for the poor Jews converted to Christ-
ianity in Judea.

Ι. That day was everywhere celebrated for the' Christian
sabbath: and, which is not to be passed over without- observ-
ing, as far as appears from Scripture, there is nowhere any
dispute of that matter. There was controversy concerning
circumcision, and other points of the Jewish religion, whether
they were to be retained 01· not retained ; but, nowhere, as we
read, concerning the changing of the sabbath. There were,
indeed, some Jews converted to the gospe13 who as in some
other things they retained a smatch of their old J udaism, so
they did in the observation of days, Rom. xiv. 5, Gal. iv. 10;
but yet not rejecting or neglecting the Lord's day. They
celebrated it, and made no manner of seruple, as appears, con-
cerning it3 but they would have their old festival days re-
tained too : and they disputed not at all whether the Lord's
day were to be celebrated, but whether the J ewish sabbath
were not to be celebrated also. So they admitted baptism,
but it went against them not to admit circumcision also.
And so also in some other articles of Judaism, not rejecting
the gospel, but superinducing something of Judaism. “ As I
have ordained in the churches of Galatia, (saith the apostle,)
so do ye also: on every first-clay (37⁴⁴ the week,'' 850. And yet
the same apostle saith of the same GalatianS, ‘⁴ ΥΘ observo
days, and months 3³³ not that they refused the Christian sab-
bath, but that they retained the J owish sabbaths.
