Θησαυρίζων· Lctyse'ngr up] “ For these (saith Beza) are true
riches laid up in lit-aven,” ἃς. By occasion of whose words
let us add these few passages of the same subject:

“Ak certain woman came to Rabban Jochanan Ben Zac-
cai, and said, ⁴ Sir, vouchsafe me sustenance' To whom he
answered, ‘And who art thou, my daughter? ‘ I‚’ saith she,
‘am the daughter of Nicodemus Ben Gori0n.’ ‘ And: replied
he, ⁶ O daughter, what is become of the riches of the family

of thy father 3³ She answcred, &Lm-m ΓζῬΠὮ ΓἾΣ Νιῖ ’Ἴ
ἻΞΠ UDX> {7¹72 'tv-lm: ‘ O Babba, (lo not they use this proverb
at Jerusalem, The salt qs riches is the want of them ? ² ,7³¹7 552&ss

ἾΞΠ But those that stood by said το her, ‘ But marey or alms is
their salt.' '' where the Gloss is : “ Whosoever will season
his rioms, that is, make them not to putrefy, let him bestow
them in alms3 and the want of riches arising from such a
cause is the seasoning of the1n.''

Ver. 5¹: Μακεδονίαν γὰρ διέρχομαι· For Ῑ (lo pass throuyh
Macedonia] There is a division about the sense and trans-
lation of these words3 and here, indeed, the whole hinge of
the controversy turns upon the place whence this Epistle
was writ.

There are some that render it to this sense; “ Ι am now
passing through Macedonia 3⁷³ which without doubt he did,
whosoever he were who first joined those words to the end
of the Episffle, Πρὸς Κορινθίους πρώτη ἐγράφη ἀπὸ Φιλίππων·
The First Epistle to the Corinthiansm was written from Phi-
lippi.- and they must do the same who think it- sent from
thence.

But the Vulgar and Interlineary interpreter, “ For I shall
pass through Macedonia,'’ in the future tense, is more true,
and best of all; for that this Epistle was sent from Ephesus
these and other things make plain:

I. That the apostlo salutes tho Corinthians in the name of
‘ the churchos of Asia ε’ which it is probable he would not at
all have done if he now were in Macedonia. But be it granted
that hc, very latcly coming out of Asia, carried the saluta-
tions of those churches along with him, it is as improbable
