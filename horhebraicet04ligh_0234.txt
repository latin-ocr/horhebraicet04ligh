ἓΞἸἾἿὩΠ ΝἾΠ nm “But how is that commun-ion made?
71⁸1& &mma ἸΞἾὩΠἿ They associatep toyether in one food,
which they prepare on the eve of the sabbath: as though
they would say, nabaz& ans &nim pamm ubiz, We alc
associate toyctlmm <md we have all one food : nor does any of us
separate a propriety from our neighbour; but as we all have
an equal right in this place which is left common to us, so we
have all an equal right in the place which every one takes to
himself for his own.”

“ And ΞἿἾΨ the consortiny togyetker, which those that dwell
among themselves in the same court make. is called ’ΞἸἾἾὩ
mam the commonicus, κοινωνίαι, of courts. And that oon-
sortiny toqetlzer, which they make that dwell among them-
selves in the same walk or entry, or which citizens of the same
city make among themselves, is called ῆἾΠἾὶὶὛ, particilmtinq
toyetlzer.''

“ They do not consort together in courts‚ ΠΞΣ Νζῖζνὶ
7:2³7: ΓῘὩὛῖῬζΠ, but with α whole loaf Although the bread of
the batch be a whole soah, if it be not a whole loafi they do
not enter into eonsortship with it. But if it be whole, if it be
no more than an asserius only, they enter into consortslaeip
with it.’'

“ How do they enter into κοινωνίαν, communion, in the
courts? They demand of every house which is in the court
one whole cake or loaf, which they lay up in one vesse‘l, and
in some house which is in the court, although it be a barn, or
a stable,'' Sto. And one of tho company blesseth‚ and so all
eat together, &c.

Compare these things with the words of the apostle, and
they do not only illustrato his argumentation, but confirm it
also. If it were customary among the Israelites to join toge-
ther in one political or economical body by the eating of many
loaves collected from this, and that, and the other man; we
arc much more associated together into one body by eating
one and the same bread appointed by one Saviour.
