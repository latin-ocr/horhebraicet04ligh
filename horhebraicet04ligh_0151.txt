'there by spirits they understood either the ghosts of dead
persons or spirits in human shape‚ but not so dreadful and
terrible as the angels. And what need is there any more
(will the Sadducee say) either of aozgyel or spirit, when Grod
before Moses died had made known his will by his writings‚
had given his eternal law, completely constituted his churchss

It is an innocent and blameless ignorance not to under-
stand τὰ βάθη τοῦ Σατανᾶ, tlze deptlas of Satan, and the secrets
ol'l1eretics3 and if in learning their doctrines we mistake, and
perhaps not a little, the shame is not much. It is venial to
err concerniny then13 to err with them is mortal. Let the
reader therefore pardon my ignomnce, if I confess Ι am·
wholly ignorant where lay the difference between the Sad-
ducee and Baithusean3 whether they agreed in one, or
whether they disagreed in some things. The Holy Scrip-
tures make no mention of the Baithuseans3 the Jewish
writings talk much of them, and in some things they seem
to be distinguished from the Sadduoees3 but in what it is
somewhat obscure.

We have the Sadducees disputing with the Phariseesd3 and
we have the Baithuseans disputing with a Phariseee3 and a
Baithnsean interrogating something of R. J oshuaf3 and fre-
