of no value or solidity: the very doctrines were different: and
some were such as could endure the trial of the fire, and
others which could not,

III. There were some who scattered grains of Judaism
among the people: but this they did not as professedly op-
posing the gospel‚ but out of ignorance, and because they (lid
not as yet sufficiently understand the simplicit-y of the gospel⁴²
Paul calls these and such like doctrines “hay and stubble‚”
to be consumed by fire: yet while they in the mean time who
had taught such things might escape, because they opposed
not the truth out of malice, but out of ignorance had broached
Falsehood.

Ver. 13: ‘H γὰρ ἡμέρα δηλώσει· ὅτι ἐν πυρὶ ἀποκαλύπτεται·
For the (lay shall dec-lare it, because it shall be rec-ealed byfire]
Two things shall discover every man’s work, the (lay and tlmfire.
Both which you may not understand amiss of the word of
God lnanitesting and proving all things. For the light of
the gospel is very frequently called the dags, and the law of
God calledfire, Dent. xxxiii. 2,

But I had rather in this place understand by the dags, the
day of the Lord that was shortly coming, and by fire, the fire
of divine indignation to be poured out upon the Jewish na-
tion. And Ι ain the more inclined to this interpretation,
because there is so frequent remembrance of that (lay and
fire in the Holy Scriptures.

When therefore there were some who built J udaism upon
the gospel foundation, and that out of unskill‘ulness and igno-
rance of the simplicity of the gospeL (for of such the apostle
here speaks‚) he foretells and threatens that the day and fire
of the Lord is coming upon the Jews: by which the folly and
inconsistency of that superstructure would not only be re-
vealed‚ but that very superstructure itself should pei-ish.

This place being taken in this sense, all the things the apo-
stle speaks in this passage become plain : that stre shall prove
doctrines, whether they are evangelical or no. If any one⁷s
work or doctrine will endure the trial of that ,ἤνις he shall
receive the reward of sound doctrine : is the doctrine of any
will not endure it, but be consnmed, he shall receive the (la-
mage of his pains and labour lost, but he himself shall be
saved; but this, as he is proved byfire.
