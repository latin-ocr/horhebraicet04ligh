18 Hebron· and Talmudz'cal [Oh. i. 18.

propo pel mezu),- rendering St. Matthew rather than St. Luke ;
and I question, indeed,whether they do rightly take the mind
of St. Matthew, while they so strictly confine the word ἀπήγ-
ξατο to bein-c] lcanpecl. I have produced my conjecture con-
cerning this business at Matt. xxvii; viz. that the devil, imme-
diately after ,J udas had cast back his money into the temple,
caught him up into the air, strangled him, threw him head-
long. and dashed him in pieces upon the ground. For,

I. It is questionable enough, whether the word ἀπήγξατο do
necessarily and singly denote lae lacmyed leimseff‚· and'not as
well, lee was laanyecl or choked ‚· and, indeed, whether the word
always supposes the halter: how the learned Heinsius hath
defended the negative, we may consult him upon this place,
and upon Matt. xxvii.

II. If Judas kcmyed himself, as is commonly believed, ancl
commonly so painted, how could it be said of him that ἐγέ-
νετο πρηνὴς, ke fell headlong] ,9 Grant that, upon the breaking
of the halter, he might fall upon the gronnd3 yet what matter
is it whether he fell on his face, or that he fell backward?

> But if πρηνὴς be derived ἀπὸ τοῦ προνεύειν, as the grammarians

would have it, it may be lceadlony as well as upon tlce βαι-6,· that
is, as upon theface is opposed τῷ ὑπτίῳ, to supine οι· back-ward.

III. Histories tell us of persons strangled by the devil.
That is a known passage in Tob. iii. 8 : “ Asmodens ,7:717 (so
it is in the Heb. of P. Fagius) strangyled Sarah's seven hus-
bands,” 850. ; and it may be the less wonder, if the devil,
being corporally seated in this wretch‚ should at last strangle
him.

IV. There are also histories of the devil snatching up some
into the air, and carrying them away with him. Now, of all
mortals, no wretch did ever more deserve so direfnl a fate than
this traitor ς nor did any other death become the most impious
of all mankind than the dreadfnllest the devil (to whom he was
entirely given up) could inflict; as what might be of most
horror to himself and terror to others.

V. The words immediately following, “That this was known
to all the dwellers at Jerusalem? ver. 19, argue it was a thing
of no common and ordinary event, and must be something
more than hanging hi1nself; which was an accident not so
very nnnsnal in that nation.
