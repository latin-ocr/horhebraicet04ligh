46 Hebraeo amc Talmudical [Oh. iv. ¹7·

Ver. 17: Ἀπειλῇ ἀπειλησώμεθα αὐτοῖς, ἆυ. Les us simitly
threaten them, offa] Ι. This incessant and implacable enmity
and stubbornness the Sanhedrim had against the doctrine
and miracles of the apostles in the name of Jesus, (of which
this was the first specimen,) did betray a most particular
spite and ill will they had towards J esus above all other men.
Let us only compare the case of J esus with that of John Bap-
tist. “ All men esteemed John a prophetZ ;'' nor did they so
much oppugn his preaching. And why should they so unani-
mously set themselves against the preaching of Jesus‚ which
was signalized with so many and so great miracles beyond
that of John the Baptist?

ΙΙ. We conceive in our notes upon John xi. 48, that the
fathers of the Sanhedrim had either a downright knowledge,
or at least a suspicion, that Jesus was indeed the Messiah;
and hence arose their hatred against his person and doctrine.
lt is much disputed and questioned concerning the testimony
which J osephus gives concerning J esus, whether it was
J osephus’s own, or whether it had not been foisted and
thrust in by some Christian. And yet in it- (excepting the
last clause) you will hardly find any thing but what the very
rulers of the Jews either owned, or at least suspected, if they
would speak out. Γίνεται δὲ κατὰ τοῦτου τὸν χρόνον Ἰησοῦς,
σοφὸς ἀνὴρ, εἴγε ἄνδρα αὐτὸυ λέγειν χρή· ἦν γὰρ παραδόξων ἕρ-
γωυ ποιητής a· About this time, there was one Jesus, α wisc man,
af v‘t be lavefficl to call himb α man : for· he wrougrht strangye
worlcs. I suspect that josephus in those words, if «it be [aufal
to call him a man, did not set the word ἄνδρα, wizan, in opposi-
tion to (iod, but in opposition to prophet, in some such sense
as this; “ If it be lawful to call him merely σοφὸν ἄνδρα, a
wisemccn [Heb. mm, and not to call him a prophet: for he
did great miracles.'’ Hc goes 011 : ‘O Χριστὸς οὗτος ἦν· This was
the Christ, Matt. xxi. 38: “When the husbandmen saw the son,
they said among themselves, This is the hcir; come, let us kill
111111.” Now if the rest of that parable agree with thc actions
of thc rulers of that nation, in [mrsecuting the prophets, and
even Christ himself, which any one may discen-m then why
may not this clause bc accounted to agree so far with them
