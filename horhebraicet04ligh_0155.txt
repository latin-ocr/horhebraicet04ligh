dren of Japheth.'' And Araelc in 13³3 ΠἾΠΞἸὩ ’,Ὃ myri:
The Greek· way of writz'nfs is most dayam. And hence is
it, 2. That the Jews, even while they were under the Roman
yoke, counted their years by the epocha or era of the Greeks,
that is, the Seleucidae. VVhence that cavil of the Sadducee3
“A certain Saddueee said, ‘ I rebuke you, O ye Pharisees,
because you write the emperor with Mosest? ” The Gloss is,
“ In writings of contraets, they write the years of the kings,
and this also, ἶῖἃἺωῆ ΠΨῩΞ ,ri-53 ΝἾΠΠ and this also 2'3 ac-
cordiny to ibe law qf Moses ancl Israel ‚·'' viz. that they might
reekon according to the years of the Seleucidae. See J osephus
and the book of MaccabeeS.

II. After the same manner that the Jews called all Gentiles
Greeks, so the Greeks called all other nations but their own
barbariam. Strabou largely discusseth the reason of that
name, and him the reader may consult. Perhaps the ety-
mology of the word may have some relation with ἾΞ bar, a
Chaldee word, which signifies without. VVhence '¹71 a stranyer,
or one of another country, in the Samaritan version is ἾΝἾΞ
a foreiyaer ; so that ἾΝἾΞ, ff: the word being doubled de-
notes a streatforez'ynerx. But to let etymologies pass, I take
notice that the Syriae in that place of the Colossians before
quoted, instead of Ἕλλην, Greek, hath NWQWN 3 for βαρβαρὸς,
barbarian, hath &³3³³ Greek, (which is chiefly to be taken
notice of,) and for Σκύθης, Scythiam, ΝἾἾΞἾΞ. whence
thesey inhabitants of Melita should be termed βάρβαροι,
barbarous people, is something obscure3 when doubtless the
island itself was under the Roman jurisdiction, which the
very name Publius, who was the chief of this island, does
make out. However, the inhabitants seem to be Africans,
brought over thither by the Carthaginians when they had
possession of that island. For I hardly think St. Luke would
call the Romans barbarismis when they were so very cultivated
a nation, and all people were ambitious of the name of a
Roman, St. Paul himself having obtained it. The people of
Melita, perhaps, were transplanted out of „Barbary itself‚ as
that part of Africa at length was called.
