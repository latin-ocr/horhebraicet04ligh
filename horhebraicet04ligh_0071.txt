called in the Jewish writings ΒἾἾἻΠἾἜὩ, which,

Ι. Must be understood of servants that were of the Jewish
nation: for this was a rule amongst them& D’lva ἾὍΝ
³392: “1227 ἾἻΠῑΗῖἾ “ It is not lawful to make a Oanccanite (or
Gentile) servant free: and if any one doth make such a one

be your bondmen for ever, Levit.xi1v.46':*but if ainy oue do
make him free, he is made free.'' There is a dispute about
this matter in Sozam,- “ R. lshmael saith, ‘There is only
17³wi a license’ ’⁹ granted (if you have a mind) of keeping a
Canaanite a bondman for ever. “But R. Akibah saith, ‘ lt
is ΠΞἾΠ a bindc'ny command,’'' that every one who hath a
Oanaanite servant is bound to keep him in his service, and
never to make him free. If it should be granted what R.
Ishmael would have, that a man might, if he please, make a
Gentile servant free. yet it is not likely there could be a whole
synagogue of sueh so made free.

freedmn, whom the Talmudie writers so frequently speak of,
they were certain Jews, who had either been sold into bondage
by the Sanhedrim for theft, or who had sold themselves for
mere poverty, and had now regained their freedom anew.

ln the servitude of these there were these differenoes. “ Ita
is a tradition: He that selleth himself is sold for six years, οι·
for more than six : he that is sold by the Sanhedrim is sold
but for six years only. He that selleth himself is not bored
