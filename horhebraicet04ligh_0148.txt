142 Hebrew and Talamdse'cal [Ch. xxiii. 8.

ἐυ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἕκτῃ, Godfinisked his work οη the ‘simle‘ (lay. The
Samaritam text agrees with this, *mun-1 0³³2 0³35& ²7:⁸5

‘The Greek version translated according to the Samaritau
text? Ι say, ‘ The Samaritam text was framed according to
this Greek version? Who shall determine this matter be-

for me; viz. that “ this alteration was made by the LXXIIx,”
But be it all one which followeth the other in this agree-
ment, we next produce, in the same chapter, Gen. ii. 19:
