day (that being supposed) was the second day after that, it
was the day of ΠἾΝἽΠ appeariny in the temple3 which pro-

ll. But if we take Jerusalem in this place in opposition
to the temple, it remembers us of the tradition concerning
the Sanhedrim's removal from the temple to the city, which
J ewish authors tell us of. “ Them Sanhedrim removed from
the room Gazitlc to the Taberna’, and from the Tabernae into
J erusalem‚'' &a where we may observe the same contradis-
tiuction between the city and the temple: for in the temple
was both Gazitlc and the Tabernce or shops. This removal
happened forty years before the destruction os Jerusalem.
“ Forty ¹¹ years before the destruction of the city the Sanhe-
drim removed. For when they observed the strange increase
of murderers amongst them, that they grew too many to be
called in question, they said, ΞᾫῩΞῙὮ mmm ,2733 :mm
It is bestfor us to remove from place to place.'’ Upon which
very words, It is best for us to remove, I cannot but remember
that passage in ‚Josephus3 “0110 the feast which is called
pentecost, the priests, according to custom, entering into the
inner temple by night, to perform the service, perceived first,
as they said, a certain motion and crack, and then a sudden
voice, Μεταβαίνωμεν ἐντεῦθεν, Let us remove from hence?
Which words whether they agree amongst themselves, and
fall in with the time now before us, let the reader himself
consider and judge. That passage in chap. v. 25 gives some
hint that the Sanhedrim at this time sat in the city, and not
in the temple 3 which the reader may also consider.

scribes, must be understood the yreat cozmcz'l .· but to distin-
guish these particularly, Ι can hardly say whether it be more
nice or more difficult. We might say that by ἄρχοντας,
rulers, might be meant Gamaliel the president, and Simeon
his son, the vice-president: by the elders, the rest of the body
of the Sanhedrim : by the scribes, either the two registrars, or
