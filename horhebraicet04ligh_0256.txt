the Lot-d’s death] lt is known what the ΠἾἎΠ 111 the Pass-
over supper was, namely, a declaration of the great works of
God in the deliveranee of the peoplo out of Egypt. The
same, as it seems, would these Judaizing Corinthians retain
in the Lord’s supper; as if the Eueharist were instituted and
superadded only for that eommemoration. The word καταγ-
γέλλετε, (1063 ν61·)1 well answer to the word ΠἼἎΠ tlae decla-
ration: and 11111116 1116 apostle admonisheth them that the
death of Christ is that which is 10 be declared, it may be
gathered that they erred in this very thing, and looked some
other way.

Ver.27b: Ἀναξίως· Umoortlcz‘ly] The apostle explains
himself, ver. 29 3 where we also will speak of this verse.

Ver. 28 ε Δοκιμαζέτω δὲ ἄινθρωπος, &o La a man examine
lzz‘mseff, (36] He had said before, ver. 19, ἵνα οῖ δόκιμοι
φανεροὶ γένωνται. that they] which are approved may be made
“nanifhst. And in the same sense 116 saith, δοκιμαζέτω, let α
mam approve himself in this place. Not so much, lat la'm try
or oramine himself, as, Zet him approve lm'mseZfl· that is, let
him show himself approved bys the Christian faitlc and doctrine.
So ehap. xvi. 3, οὓς ἐὰν δοκιμάσητε, whomsoevffl· με shall ap-
prove. We meet with the word in the same sense very often.

Ver. 29: Μὴ διακρίνων τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Κυρίου· Not discerninq
tlte Lord's body] This is to be meant of the proper aet of
the understanding: viZ. of the true judgment concerning 1116
nature and signification of the sacrament. If it were said
indeed, μὴ διακρίνων τὸν Κύριον, not discernens] the Lord, it
might be rendered in the same sense as “he knew not the
Lord ;’' that is, ‘⁶ 116 101163 him not, he fem-s him not, he wor-
ships him not.'' But when it is said, μῗ] διακρίνων τὸ σῶμα,
not discernam the body, it plainly speaks of the aet of the
understanding : “ He does not rfiyktly distinquislc of the body
of the L0r‹l.’' And this was a grievous orror of these J uda-
izing Corinthians, who would see nothing of the body of
Christ in the Eucharist, or ofhis death ; 111611· eyes being too
intent upon the commenmration of the l‘assoverC. They
retained the old leaven of Judaism 111 11113 new l'assover of
the Eucharist. And this was their partaking of 1116 sacra-
