RJGHT Honommmnz,

ALL that I have done in this work may well seem a continued
solecism: when Ι have with so unskilful a hand attempted to ex—
plain so abstruse an epistle‚ and handled things so difficult in so
brief a manner 3 and, lastly, in daring to dedicate these so unpolished
papers to a person of such judgment and learning. And what
account shall I give of these things ’Ζ

Ι know indeed that among those δυσνόητά τινα, passages hard ιο be
understood, which are in St. Paul's Epistles‚ [2 Pet. iii. 16‚] this
First to the Corinthians claims no small share 3 an Epistle behind
none for the variety of the things handled, and for the difficulty of
the style wherewith they are handled above all. Things these are
to be trembled at, but alluring withal‚ and provoking a mind greedy
of the knowledge of Holy Scriptures so much the more to the study
of them, by how much they are the more difficult. So that it was
neither arrogance nor rashness that I employed myself in these ob-
scurities 3 but a studious mind, breathing after the knowledge of the
Scriptures, and something restless, when in difficult places it knew
not where to fix. What fruit I have reaped, I say not any thing of
but this, that I repent not of my pains z for I have in some measure
satisfied myself 3 but whether I shall do others, is not in my power
