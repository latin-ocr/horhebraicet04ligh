] 14· Habron- and Talmmlical [Oh. xiii. 9.

1. Because it may reasonably bc doubted whether St. Lukc
would explain μάγος. a well-known word, by a word far more
unknown. Resides. why should this soreerer only be called
Elymas, whenas, according to that etymology, all persons of
the same art might have the same name?

2. Because the Syriae and Arabio do not begin the word
Elyflnas with the letter y but N. Ι little doubt, therefore,
but this name Elymas takes its original from the Arabio
word ΝΌἾίῙΝ Alima οι· Elima, which signifies ro yrieve or be
tormented. And how this sense agrees with the word mum
any one may see: for what can be nearer akin than lo con—
sume away, and to qrievffi· and to waste away bys a dis-
temper, and be under torment? So that l suppose this
sorcerer was called in his own Hebrew name wamy* 52 Bar-
jesus, and went by that name among the Hebraizing Jews:
but amongst those that spake Arabio, Elymas: which in
the Arabic tongue signifies the same thing. Ι consess it is
a sornewhat unusual thing for St. Luke to render a Hebrew
name by Arafflc, and not by Greek3 which the evangelists
commonly do. But it seems that this magician was born and
bred in some place or country where the Arabic was the
mother-tongue, inhabited by Jews also that used their own
language3 and from thence he came to be known by this
twofold name. I am mistaken if Jabneh itself, a known
academy of the Jews, and sometimes the seat of the Sanhe-
drim, was not in such a country. For it may be made out
elsewhere that it is very probable the whole Philist-ine coun-
try, at least the greatest part of it, did use the Arabio as
their mother-tongue.

Ver. 9: Σαῦλος δὲ, ὁ καὶ Παῦλος· leen Saul, who also is
called Paul] Here is both his Hebrew and Roman name
too, upon the account of that relation he had to both nations.
He was by his parentage a ὕων, and so called Saul; but
withal he was a free denizen of Rome, and thence had the
name of Paul. Under the same notion Silas is called Sic-
vamts .· for he also was a citizen of Rome, as may be collected
out of Acts xvi. 37. The apostlc, having hitherto converscd
chiefly amongst the Jews, retains his Jowish name; but being
now dcclared the apostlc of the Gentiles⁷ and travelling among-st
the Gentiles, St. Lukc gives him his Gentilo name only.
