used that version or no, is no unjust question. Asb also,
whether he were a J ew or a proselyte; whether a proselyte
made, or a mere Gentile3 whether a eunuch in the strict or
in the lai-ger sense: which things are not to be inquired into,
because we can nowhere be resolved about them. The per-
verseness of the Jews is more obvious, who, to elude these
express and plain things about the sufferings of the Messiah‚
do divert the whole sense of this chapter to another thing.
It goes current amongst them that the afflicted people of
Israel are the subject of this prophecy; although there are
those who would apply part of it to Jeremiah3 others, part of
it to ‘ R. Judah the Holy3’ nay, some there are that will
allow some part of it to the Messias himself, in the mean
time providing that they admit not of his death. It would
be very tedious to set down particularly their trifiings and
illusions in this matter: I rather inquire who it is that the
Greek interpreters apply this passage to? whether they
plainly and sincerely understood them of the sufferings and
death of the Messiah? Let those answer for them who would
have them inspired by the Holy Ghost. If they were thus
inspired, they could not but attain the true sense and scope
of the Scripture, as well as the grammatica] signification of
the words, and could not but discern here that the prophet
treats of an afflicted, suffering, dying, buried Messias, διο.

And if so, how strange a thing is it that the whole nation
should be carried away with so cursed, perverse, and obstinate
a denial of the Messiah's death! What! fm- seventy-two doc-
tors and guides of the people, and those divinely inspired too,
so plainly to foresce the sufferings and death of the Messiah
soretold in this cha-pter, and yet not to take care to disperse
this doctrine amongst the people, nor deliver and hand it
down to posterity ἓ But if they did do it, how came so horrid
an averseness to this doctrine to seize the whole natione If
they did not, what execrable pastors of the people were they,
to conceal so noble and so necessary an article of their saith,
and not inlpart it l

In like manner do thc Jews commonly apply that famed
prophecy of Christ, Isa. ix. 6, to king Hezekiah. I doubt
