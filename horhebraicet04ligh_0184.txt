the Gloss: “ The eyes of the prophets could not see these
things.'’

You ‘see here the Rabbin distinguishes between the (lays
of Blesssc‘alz and the world to corne,- which is sometimes
done by others; but they are very commonly confounded.
And you see upon what reason, yea upon what necessity he
was driven to this distinction, namely, that he supposed some
things laid up for those that waited for clod, which the eyes
of the prophets never saw. “ But (saith he) the prophets saw

are laid up for the world to come, after the days of the Mes-
siah.'' Rabbin‚ learn from Paul, that the revelation under the
¹gospel is far more bright than the prophets ever attained to.

the apostle is speaking of doctrines, is plain by the context:
