the same thing, ochcurs very frequently: and so they interpret

l3ut passing over this, that this interpretation seems to
betray an ignorance of the word ΠὮΝ, from whence soleam-
matha is derived, the Tahnudists, to whom that word is suffi-
ciently common and well known, produce another etymology
of the word >tf-11⁸2& sahammatha. &nme ”Nm Wlfflgb sifflmfies

What the apostle means by ‚Mamm-atha we shall more
easily trace when we shall have observed this first, that
the apostle chiefly directs the (lint and stroke of this ana-
thema and curse against the unbelieving Jews, who were most
bitter enemies against the Lord Jesus and his gospel : which
I cannot but think, being induced thereunto by these four
reasons:

Ι. Because the Jews, above all other of the human race,
Zoved not the Lord Jesus, neither yet do loz-e him. The holy
Scripture teaches this abundantly ; unhappy experience
teaches it. The pagans, indeed, love not Christ, because
they know him not: but, because they know him not, neither
do they hate him. The Turks, indeed, love «not Jesus in that
manner as the Christians do, but they do not hate him in
that manner as do the Jews.

II. Because he speaks here in the language and dialect of
the Jews, namely‚ in that Syriae phrase. sslaran-allm. He
had spoken Greek through the whole Epistle; he speaks
Greek in all his Epistles: but when he speaks here in the
Jewish language, the thing itself speaks it, without all con-
troversy, that he speaks concerning the Jews.

ΠΙ. The Jews only of all mortals called Jesus avom-sed
(see ehap. xii. 1.): therefore the apostle deservedly strikes
them, above all other mortals, with a curse, rendering like
for like.
