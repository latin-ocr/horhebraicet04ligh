little one, we will only examine the different-e between the two
articles τῷ and τῇ.

Ahab had introduced Baal, the idol of the Tyrians, amongst
the lsraelites, ι Kings xvi.31. And were there but seven
thousand amougst the whole ten tribes of lsrael that did not
worship this Baal? Perhaps there were seventy thousand:
nay, perhaps seven times seventy thousand. For consider the
story in 2 Kings x. 21 ; and it will appear that the worship-
pers of this Baal were not so numerous that they could amount
to many thousands, perhaps not many hundreds.

But0 what did it avail them not to have worshipped Ahab's
BaaL if in the mean time they worshipped J eroboam'sP calves'}
Jehu himself, that rooted Baal and his worshippers out of
Israel, yet did not he depart from the sin of J eroboam‚ ’
namely, the golden calves. And what great matter was there
in this divine answer (χρηματισμὸς) to Ehjah, if it had said,
“I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have
not worshipped τὸν Βάαλ, Βααί,” the god of the Tyrians‚ if in
the mean time they worshipped the calves in common with
the rest of that nation? Elijah himself had slain these wor-
shippers of Baal before he had this answer from God; and
therein indeed had done a great aet. But it was a small
matter if all Israel, exeepting seven thousand only, should still
worship this Baal.

By τῇ Βάαλ therefore, with the feminine article, the apostle
teacheth us that it must be understood not τῇ εἰκόνι Βάαλ, of
‘ the imaqe' qf Raab, but τῇ δαμάλει Βάαλ, of ‘ the cagf’ of Baal.
For all will confess that Baal was a common name for all idols.
And that whieh follows 1 Kiugs xix. 18, “ every mouth which
hath not kissed him‚'’ takes light from that in Hos. xiii. 2,
‘⁶ Lot them kiss the calves.”

Now Jeroboam's ealves aro called δαμάλεις in the feminine
gender3 1 Kings xii. 28, ἐποίησε δύο δαμάλεις χρυσᾶς, lae made
two calvas Ofyold. So Josophus, Δύο (1 ποιήσας δαμάλεις χρυσᾶς,
τίθησι τὰς δαμάλεις, &C-; Jeroboam making] two yolclen calvos,
places them, &a And instead of more, the Book of Tobit
commonts suffieiontly upon τῇ Βάαλ, Tob. i. 5; καὶ πᾶσαι αἱ
φυλαὶ συναποστᾶσαι ἔθυον τῇ Βάαλ τῇ δαμάλει, (mul all tlte tribes
