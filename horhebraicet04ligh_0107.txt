also the Greek interpreters lean that way3 that clause, ’Ἇξω
ὑγίειαν αὐτῷ, Ι will restore healtlz, or soundness, lo kim, gives a
suspicion of it.

Ver-33: Ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει αὐτοῦ ἡ κρίσις αὐτοῦ ἤρθη’ [η
his humiliatioaz, lais juclfflnent uus taken away] The Hebrew
text is, Πίῖτζ) Ὦξῖζέᾩᾬῆ Ἶίζῖῗῗῦ He was taken from prison aad
from judyment .· which the Seventy read thus, 'mmm 5729:
Πῑῖῖἳ. If you render the word ¹533> in the same sense with

ΠᾙἻἾ1 *3237 Ἶξτζῃέ 1 Sam. xxi. 8, Doegy (for devotion, saith
Kimehi) 'uias detained before the Lord ,· then is shown so much
the greater wrong done to Christ. He was snatched from
the place of his devotion, and from his work; and he was
snatched from the place of judgment, that he could neither
be safe in that, nor have just judgment in the other. Any
one knows what ΠἾΣζὩ signifies, namely, bein-(7 detained upon a
reliqvious account.- and what affinity the word '5337 to shut up,
may have with it, every one may also see.

Τὴν δὲ γενεὰν αὐτοῦ τίς ὃιηγήσεται; Who shall (leolam his
yeneration 52] That is, “W ho shall declare the wickedness of
that age or yeneration wherein he lived, and by whom 116
suffered such things 3⁷² This and such like passages are very
usual amongst thec Jews. ‘⁶ In d the ιςιιεηθναίεὶὶπ 111 which the
Son of David shall come, the synagogue shall be a common
stews; Galilee shall be destroyed and Gablan shall be laid
waste3 the wisdom of the Scribes shall putrefy3 good and
merciful men shall fai13 yea, and truth itself shall fail; and
the faces of that generation shall be as the faces of dogs.
R. Levi saith, The Son of David shall not come but in a yene-
ration wherein men⁸s faces shall be impudent, and which will
deserve to be cut off. R« J annai saith, When thou seest the
yeneration after the slandering and blaspheming qeneratiom
then expect the feet of King Messias‚’' that is, his coming.
While I read the Ghaldee paraphrast in Isa. liii, methinks I
see a forehead not unlike the faces before mentioned: for he
wrests the prophet’s words with that impudence and perverse-
ness from their own proper sense, that it is a wonder if his
own conscience, while he was writing it, did not check and
admonish him.
