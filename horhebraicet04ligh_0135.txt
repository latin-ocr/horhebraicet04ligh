preters from that ham-ed, should envy them those things
which Amos had foretold should happen to them ‘⁶ that re-
mained of Edom,” and diverted his words another way:
“ Thisi is the offering thou shalt receive from them, gold,
silver‚ and brass, Exod. xxv. 3. 'she gold is Bahel: the silve-r
is Media: the brass is Greece, Dan. ii: but there is no men-
tion of iron: why so? Because wicked Edom, that wastod the
sanctuary, is likened to that; to teach us that Grod in time
to coine will accept an offering from every kingdom except
Edom.''

Ver. 20: Ἀπέχεσθαι ἀπὸ τῶν ἀλισγημάτων τῶν εἰδώλων καὶ τῆς

diametrically contrary to this decree of the apostles, Rev. ii.
14, 20. Those Balaamites and Jezebelites‚ with what paint
could they beautify t-hat horrid and accursed doctrine and
practice of theirs3 was it the liberty of the gospel they pre-
tended? or rather, did they not abuse that love and charity
commanded in the gospel? namely, making a show of some
more transcendent friendship amongst themselves, they would
eat any thing with any man, and lie carnally with any
woman.

I have ostentimes thought of those words of the apostle,
ι Tim. iv. 3, “forbidding to mar1·y.” Who were these that V
forbade to marry? but especially upon what account did they
forbid it? We know. indeed, upon what unreasonable reason
marriage is forbidden to some in the Romish communion in
these latter ages of the world: but to whom and upon what
