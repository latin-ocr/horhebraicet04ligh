Ch. xi. 26.] Eam-citatiores upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 249

only a seal as a sacrament, but the very sanction of the new
testament3 that is, os the whole evangelio administration, not
only the sanction of a covenant, but the sanction of the cove-
nant under the evangelic administration. From thenceforth
was the cessation of Judaism. So that blood, Exod. xxiv,
was not only the sanction of the covenant of grace, and the
sanction of the covenant of the peculiarity of the people of
Israel, but the sanction of these things under such an eco-
nomy.

II. While therefore we receive this sacrament, we profess
and protest against all other dispensations and religions be-
sides that of the gospel. Hence in the times immediately
following the ascension of Christ, the communication of the
Eucharist was so frequent3 viz. that they who had been now
newly converted from J udaism by the use of this sacrament,
might show that they renounced their J udaism‚ and professed
the saith and economy of the gospel.

III. Our communion therefore in this sacrament is not so
much spiritual as external, and declarative of our common
and joint profession of the Christian faith. We are far from
denying that the saints have a spiritual communion with God,
and among themselves in the use of the Eucharist3 yea, we
assert there is a most close communion between true believers
and God. But what is that spiritual communion of saints
among themselves? Mutual love, one heart, prayers for one
another, 830. But they may exercise the same communion,
and do exercise it, when they meet together to any other part
of divine worship. They may and do act the same thing,
when they are distant from one another. Therefore their
communion in this sacrament, which is distinctly called the
‘communion of the Eucharist,' is, that they meet together,
and, by this outward sign, openly and with joint minds pro-
fess that they are united in 0116 sacred knot and bond of
Christian religion, renouncing all other religions.

IV. When therefore we approach to the Eucharist in any
church, we do not only communicate with that congregation
with which we associate at that time, but with the whole
catholic church in the profession of the true evangelie
religion.
