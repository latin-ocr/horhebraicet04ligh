adore it, not under the notion of an idol, but in honour of the
king, it is nothing.’⁷

Hieronymus a Sancta Fide citesS this Talmudic passage in
these words ; “ They say in the book Sanhedrim, If any wor-
ship an idol out of love or sear, he is free: and R. Solomon
glosseth thus 3 By love is understood that if any master should
ask his servant that out of love to him he would adore him ε
by sear, that if any master should threaten him unless he
would. Nevertheless, R. Moses of Egypt glosseth otherwise,
saying, That by love is understood, if he be in love with the
beauty of the image of that idol 3 by sear, that if he sear the
idol should hurt him, as the worshippers of it think that it
can profit or hurt 3 and that if he adore it in such a case, he
is free.''

omit other things, mark that which prevailed also with these
Corinthians: ΓἭῙᾎΝΞ, ΠἾὶῇζῖ trba? NL* D& “If ke acknow-

these men said also, “ ‘ An idol is nothing? therefore to be in
an idol-temple, to eat things offered to idols, is nothing, for
I own nothing of the Deity in the idol, I know it is wood or
stone‚⁷' &c But saith the apostle,

First, “ However the idol itself be wood or stone, yet those
things which are offered to it are offered to devils,'' chap.
x. 20. And,

Secondly, “ However you think yourself so wise as to judge
of an idol as a matter of nothing, yet all have not so accurate
a judgment: and you, by your example, encourage others to
eat things offered to idols, even under the notion of things
offered to idols.’'

He useth the very same argument and reason, Rom. xiv. ι 5.
And his words respect the quality of the person rather than
the person himself, barely considered. As though he had
said, “ For tender consciences‚ and trembling at the word of
God, for those that are burdened and groan under the yoke
and weight of the law, for such as sweat and pant in the ways
of the Lord, to keep saith and a good conscience3 for such
