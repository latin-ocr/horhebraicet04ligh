Ver. ι] : Λυκαονιστί· In tlze speech of Lycaonia] lt is hard
to say what the Lycaoniam tongue was 3 nor is it easy to say
why this was added, when it might have sufficed to have said,
leey list up their voices, sayingy, The θοοῖς, 8ῑο.

Ι. I should hardly be persuaded the Lycaonian language
was any Greek dialect, when it sufficiently appears by what
I lately quoted out of Strabo that there were peculiar mother-
tongues in these countries distinct from the Greek. And he
himself remarkethy that the Carians, who are situated some-
thing nearer Greece than the Lycaonians, were called by
Homer βαρβαρόφωνοι, people of a baar-bamus lanquaye. So the
Phrygians also were barbari, barbarouSZ.

Let us hear once again what Strabo saitha: “The Cap-
padocians, who use the same language‚ are those chiefly who
are bounded southward with that part of Cilicia that is called
Taurus, eastward by Armenia and Colchis; καὶ τοῖς μεταξὺ
ἑτερογλώττοις ἔθνεσι, and otker interjacent coumm'es that use a
dffire1nt ἷαηρααρθῖ) What amongst these other Zauquayes
should be the Lycaonian, let him find out that hath leisure
and capacity to do it; as for my part, I neither can nor dare
attempt it.

VER. 2: Γενομένης οὖν στάσεως καὶ σηζητήσεως, &Q Dissen-
sion and clisputation, ἔξω] Were I to render these words into
the Talmudic language (which was the school-language) I
would render στάσεως by &5³2²le and συζητήσεως by ΝΠἿῺἿΞ,
terms very well known in the schools3 according to which
idion] if they were expounded there would be no difficulty
in them.

’Έταξαν ἀναβαίνειν Παῦλον, &c They determined that Paul
should 90 up, εἷτα] Of this journey Paul himself makes some
mention, Gal. ii. ι ; where he intimates that lle went 212) by
revelation: that is, given to the n1i11isters of Antioch3 for
it would not have been said ἔταξαν, {heys datm-minaci, if the
revelation had been made to Paul himself. Amongst others
that accompanied him in his journey, Titus was one; but
where he adopted him to himself, in those his journeys de-
scribed chap. xiii and xiv, let him guess that can.
