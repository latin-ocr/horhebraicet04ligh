are in mean esteem amongst them, and the tribe of Ephraim,
i.e. (ifI may so speak) the Samaritan tribe, being of greatest
account, it is the less wonder if they are not so very solicit-
ous, at least do not boast so much of the heads of the other
tribes.

Καὶ ἐτέθησαν ἐν τῷ μνήματι ὃ ὠνήσατο Ἀβραὰμ τιμῆς ἀργυρίου,
παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ἐμμὸρ τοῦ Συχέμ· And laid in tlte sepulchre {leat
Abraham bochlzt for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the
father ofss‘yclaem] This passage is not a little obscure: not
very unlike that in Gen. l. 53 Joseph saith, “ My father made
me swear, saying, ‘ Lo, Ι· die? In my grave ³³7 ’wan Ἶζζῗζζὲ
which I have cl'iyqedfor me, or which I leave purchased jor· oley-¹

word ἾΓΥἸᾛ, whether it should be rendered, I leave diyyed, as
the Greek, Jonathan's Targumr, &cn have rendered it; Ol‘
whether it should be, I hace bouylet, as Onkelos, the Syriae,
and the Talmudists. Be it the one or the other, seeing the
discourse is plainly about the cave of Machpelah, how can we
say either this or that is true? Ι little question the former
sense: for when Abraham had bought the cave, and (ligged a
sepulchre in it for himself and Sarah, reason will tell us that
Isaac did the same for himself and Rebekah‚ and Jacob for
himself and Leah; for they both dwelt in Hebron as well as
Abraham. But if we will admit of the latter sense, which the
Rabbins tenaciously adhere to, there is no less a difficulty oc-
curs than what is now before us. They indeed remove it by
this blessed comment, viz. that when Jacob purchased the
birthright from Esau, he did, by a peculial· writing and deed
of contract, include this cave within the bargain, as his own
propriety. We may read the whole figment in Sotah and the
Targum of J onathan in the places above quoted.

But to take this matter in hand a little more seriously.

I. It had been enough for Stephen to have made mention
of the burial of Jacob and the patriarchs, without any addi-
tion about the purchase of the burying-place‚ if he had not a
design to hint something peculiar in the mention he makes of
it. Nor did it make for his cause at all. to tell over a bare
story, which they all knew, if there were not something iu-
cluded in it that made for his defence. He had said before,
