that it is said, “ 116 commanded them that they should not
depart from ‚Jer11salen1,''&c.; as if it should necessarily be
supposed that they were now at Jerusalem: that passage
ver. 6, οἱ οὖν συνελθόντες, when they were come tofmthm‘, may
signify their assembling in that plaee; and the words παρήγ-
γειλεν αὐτοῖς, lze commanded them, ac„ may very well be con-
strued‚ that lae commanded them to repair straightway to J eru-
salem, and not to depart thence.

and done 111 1116 mountain of Galilee (where probably the five
hundred at once were together to see him, 1 Cor. xv. 6), and
that when the time of his ascension drew near. For reason
would persuade us that they would not delay their return into
the city when 116 had commanded them thither3 nor that he
commanded them thither but when the time drew near
wherein he was to meet them there.

the matter within too narrow a compass of time, and seem
