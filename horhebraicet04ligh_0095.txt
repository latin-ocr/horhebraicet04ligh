struction, “ that men might be disposed into the same pre-
dicament or state with the angels ;” then I should think our
blessed martyr might in this passage remember them of their
own opinion, and the more smartly convince them of their
ἀνομία, lransffl'ession (ψ’ the law, even from what they them-
selves granted5 as though he had said, ‘⁶ Ye have received
a law which you yourselves confess would have put men into
an angelical state, and yet you have not observed it.''

Il. But if this clause will not bear that interpretation, it
is doubtful in what sense the word ἀγγέλων must be taken;
and whether εἰς διαταγὰς, ιιῑιίο ίΙιθ dispo-silicas, be the same
διὰ διαταγῶυ, 01· διὰ διαταγῆς, by the disposition& or disposition.
That expression in Gal. iii. ¹9 agrees with this, διαταγεὶς δι’
ἀγγέλων, ordained by anyels ,· and in both these places it would
be something harsh to understand by anyels those heavenly
spirits strictly and properly so taken: for what had they to
do in the disposition of the law? They were present indeed
at mount Sinai when the law was given, as many places of
the holy Scriptures do witness3 but then they were but pre-
sent there: for we do not find that any thing further was
done or performed by them. So that the thing itself makes
it necessary that both in this and in that place we should
understand by mayel& the messenffiff‘s of God’s word, his pro-
phets and ministers. And the particle εἰς may retain its own
proper force and virtue, that the sense may come to thus
much; viz. “ Ye have received the law ιιιιίο tlae disposition of
messenyem, i. e. that it should be propounded and published
byX ministers, prophets, and others3 and that according to
your own desire and wish, Exod. xx. 19, Deut. v. 25, and
xviii. 15, 163 and yet ye have not kept the law. Ye desired
prophets, and ye had them: and yet which of those prophets
have not you persecuted 3”

frequently calls himself the Son of man, but it is rarely that
we find him so called by others. But, St. Stephen in this
expression recites that of Dan. vii. 13 : ‘⁵ I saw one like the
