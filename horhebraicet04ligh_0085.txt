“ Abraham passed through the land unto the place of Sychem.

Samarit., to the vale qu‘sion, &c But our inquiry is for tho
place rather than the etymology. Deut.xi. 29,30; “Thou shalt
put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon
mount Ebal. Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the.
way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites,
who dwell in the champaign overagainst G‘ilgal *25³7ss ζῗζζὲᾗέ
mm besides the plains ofllsoreh ?''

'Let us take the Talmudic comments upon this place ;
“ Whent the Israelites had passed over Jordan, they came
to mount Gerizim and mount Ebal‚ which are in the country
of Samaria, near Sychem, which is besides the plain of Moreh.
according as it is said, ‘ Are they not on the other side ‚Jor-
‹lan‚' &03 And it is said elsewhere, ⁶ Abraham passed through
the land unto the place of Sychem to the plain of Morehs
What isu the plain of Mol-eh there, Gen. xii. 63 It is Sychem.
And so the plain of Moreh is Sychem here also, Dent. xi. 303v
‘⁴ R. EliezerX Ben Jose saith, ⁶ In this thing have Ι accused
the Samaritan books of falsifyings and Ι said unto them,
‘ Ye have falsified your law, and gained nothing by it3 for
you say DDKU ΠἾἾΌ ’3Ἳέἶῆ the plain of Moreh which ‘is Sychem:
for we confess that the plain of Moreh is Syche1n.''' The
Samaritan text in Deut. xi. 30 hath 0:122 ³²:572 ΠἾἾῺ ἶἾῖἳΝ
the plain of hloreh near Sychem ; but no such thing in Gen.
xii. 6 is added.

ΠΥ the word μνήματι, in the sepulchre, did not lay some ob-
stacle in the way, I should easily conceive that Stephen had
his eye as intent (if not more) upon this place as upon the
cave of Machpelah. It is not said, that Abraham bought this
place, much less that he bought it for a burying-place: but
