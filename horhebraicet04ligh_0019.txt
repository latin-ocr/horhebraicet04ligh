with the seem-‘qe qs rebellion; that is7 if 116 go so far as twelve
miles: but> if he go out of the city beyond twelve miles, though
it be but the space of one cubit, 116 13 scourged according to
the law.” Let us comment· a little.

I. lt was commonly believed, that the Israelites’ encamping
iu the wilderness was about twelve miles square : “ Theu length
of the Israelites' camp was twelve miles, and the breadth
twelve miles.''

‘⁸ The breadth of the waters'* (that is, those that were cli-
vided in Jordan) “ was twelve 1111163, answerable to the camp
of Israel, according as our Rabbins expound it x, The waters
which came down from above stood and rose up upon a heap,
Josh. iii. 16. And what was the height of these waters? lt
was twelve miles' height upon twelve miles7 breadth, according
to the camp of Israel? NVhere the Gloss 13, “ Τ116 camp of
the Israelites was twelve miles upon twelve miles⁹⁹ (that 13,
twelve 1111163 square) : ‘² and they passed over Jordan accord-
ing 10 111611· encampings ; viz. the whole breadth of their camp
passed over together for the space of twelve miles >2⁵³ Hence
that in Hieros. Sozam, ‘⁶ Adam and Zarethan'’ (i. e. the place
from whence and the place to which the waters were divided)
‘² were distant from one another twelve miles.”

'Whether they took 1116 number of twelve miles p1·ecisely‚
from allusion to 1116 twelve 1111163, or from any other reason
retained that exact number and space, is not easy to deter-
mine: yet this is certain, that the Israelites' camp was very.
spacimrs, and had a very large compass, especially granting a
miles distance between the first 161113 and the tabernacle.
And indeed, as to this commonly received opinion of the
camp's being twelve miles square 011 every side, we shall
hardly believe it exceeds the just proportion‚ if we consider
the vast numbers of that people: nay, it might rather seem a
wonder, that the encamping of 30 many myriads, or rather 30
many hundred thousands‚ should not exceed that proportion.
Place the tabernacle in the midst; allow the space of one mile
from each side of it (in which space were the tents of the
Levites), before you come to the first tents of the Israelites;
and then guess what length and breadth and thickness all
the other tents would take up.
