Ch. ii. ι.] Exercitations upon τὴν Acts. ⁶25

fifty days are reckoned by some from the resurrection of our
Lord; and then Pentecost, or the fiftietlo days, must fall on
the first day of the week, that is, our L0rd”s day: but if we
number the days from the common epocha, that is, from the
time of offering the sheaf of firstfruits (which account doubt-
less St. Luke 'doth follow), then the daps of Penta-ost fell out
upon the J ewish sabbath. And here, by the good leave of
some learned men, it may be questioned, ‘ thether the
Holy Ghost was poured out upon the disciples on the very
clay ofPentecost, or no.’ Tho reasons of this question may
be these :

I. The ambiguity of the words themselves, ἐν τῷ συμπλη-
ροῦσθαιῑ( τὴν ἡμέραν, which niay be either rendered, as we have
done in English, when τήν <lay of Pentecost was fully come ,· or
as they in the Italian, E nel finire del giorno della Pentecoste,
q. d. when it was fully yeme. So that the phrase leaves it
undetermined, whether tlce clay of Pentecost was fully come
or fidly grone : and what is there could be alleged against it,
should we render it in the latter sense?

II. It is worthy our observation, that Christ the antitype,
in answering some types that represented him, did not tie
himself up to the very day of the type itself for the fulfilling
of it, but put it off to the day following. So it was not upon
the very day of the Passover, but the day following, that
ἐθύθη αὐτὸς Πάσχα ἡμῶν, Οἰινίεί ozor Passover was sacrtfieed for
usl .- it was not on the very day that the sheaf of the first-
fruits was offered, but the day following, that Christ became
ἀπαρχὴ τῶν κεκοιμημένων, the firszssm'ts of them that sleptm.
So also did he institute the Christian sabbath not the same
day with the Jewish sabbath wherein God had finished the
work of his creation, butn the day following, wherein Christ
had finished the work os his redemption. And so it was
agree-able to reason, and to the order wherein he disposed of
things already mentioned, that he should indulge that myste-
rious gift of the Holy Ghost, not upon the day of the Jewish
sabbath, but the day following, the day of his own resurrec-
tion from the grave3 that the Spirit should not be poured
out upon the same day wherein the giving of the law was
