say, ‘I have something to offer in behalf of the condemned
person‚' he waves the handkerchiefi and the horseman rides
and calls the people back. Nay, if the man himself say, ‘I
have something to offer in my own defence‚’ they bring him
back four or five times, one after another, if it be any thing
of moment that 116 hath to say.” I doubt they hardly dealt
so gently with the innocent Stephen.

ΙΙΙ. If no testimony arise that makes any thing for him,
then they go on to stoning him: “The crier proclaiming
before 111111, N, the son of N, 6011168 forth to be stoned for

If he die so, well; if not, then the other witness takes up a
stone, and lays it upon his heart. If he die 80, well; but if
not, then he 18 stoned by all Israel.”

VH. “All that are stoned are hanged also,” 810. These
things I thought fit to transcribe the more largely, that 1116
reader may compare this present action with this rule and
common usage of doing it.

1. It may first be questioned for what crime this person
was condemned to die. You will say, For blasphemy: “ For
we have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses
and against God.” But no one is condemned as a blasphemer
