R.As}1erd sticks in this business why Bar Kaphra and
R. Chaija submitted themselves thirty days to that 'rep1·oof,'
when it extended not itself beyond seven days: concerning
which let· the render see, if he be at leisure. what he dis-
com-seth.

'she difference between 75:5³3: 1⁷(J;·r(1qf‚n1id ἾἾἻἾΞ ‹unvammans-
σαίὶωι, was this:

Ι. That reprom , 01· eorreption‚ had not need of absolut-ion 3
arcontium? ica( ion ha d.

Il. Although he who was struck with such reproof kept
himself within (loom. and went not abroad as a man ashamed,
yet others abstained not from his company. Before him who
had struck him with that thunder he appeared not, nor con-
versed in public3 yet any one might resort to him at home.
So R Chaija is said to have taught Rabh nt home those
thirty days.

‘⁸ Reproqf ΠΞἾΞ (say the masters) is, when some eminent
man chides another, saying, How impudent is N„ or some-
thing of that nature. Now the condition of a man thus chid-
den, or reproved, is this: he hides himself, and keeps himself
at home as one ashamed, that he may not see his face who
shamed him; nor does he stand before him with his head un-
covered. He abates also of his laughter, and of his words,
and of his business, and makes himself sad before those that
see him. But there is no need for him to withdraw himself
from men, but he may eat and drink with them, and salute
them. Nor needs he to please him that reproved him, nor
needs he absolution: but when he luith taken the reproof
upon him, and the time is expired, he is free.” Compare the
words of the apostle‚ ι Tim. v. ι, πρεσβυτέρῳ μὴ ἐπιπλήξῃς, &c.
rebecke not an elder,> &c. with this ΠΞἾΞ.

And now to pass to ‹mcommunication itself.

I. Excommemication was devised and found out by the Jews,
if my eyes see anything, to be a punishment of those stnilts
for which there was no other punishment decrccd, either in
the H oly Scriptures, or in the traditions. Ι believe he scarcely
was excommunica-ted among the Jews, for whose ofl'ence the
punishment either of cutting off, or of death, οι· of whipping,
oi· of restitution ‹›f double or f‹u11f‹›l‹l,&‹=.. was openly :tp-
