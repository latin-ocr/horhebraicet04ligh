THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLEs,

(tHAP. 1,

WTER. Ι : Τὸν μὲν πρῶτον λόγον ἐποιησάμην, &c The formet·
treatise leave I made, ἔξω] W e may reduce to this place (for
even thus far it may be extended) what our historiam had
said in the very entrance of his Gospel, ἕὸοξε *almi καθεξῆς
σοὶ γράψαι, it seemeael qood to me also to write anto thee 1ἰη order.-
where καθεξῆς, in order, seems to promise, not only an orderly
series of the history of the actions of our Saviour, but succes-
sively, even of the apostles too. For what passages we have
related to us in this book may very well be reckoned amongst
the πράγματα πεπληροφορημέυα, those thz'v'zys which are most surely
believed among] us. Indeed, by the very style in this place he
shews that he had a design of writing these stories jointly;
that is to say, first to give us a narration of the actions and
doctrine of Christ, and then, in their due place and order, to
commit to writing the acts and sayings of the apostles,

As to most of the things contained in this book, St. Luke
was both αὐτόπτης, (cn eyewz‘tness, yea, and a part also: but
how far he was spectator of those acts of our Saviour which
he relat-es in his other book, none can say. What he speaks
in the preface of —that work is ambiguous, ἔδοξε κάμοὶ πᾶσιν ἄνω-
θεν παρηκολουθηκότι, and leaves the reader to inquire whether
he means, he had α perfect mzdersz‘amliny of all thinys from the
ver-yfirst, by the same only way which those had that unde1·t‹;›0k
to compile the evangelical histories from the mouth αὐτοπτῶι1
