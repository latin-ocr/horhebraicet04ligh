‘⁶ inheritance in the promised land, no, not so much as to set
his foot on :³⁵ and here he tells them, that evon Jacob and tho
patriarchs had no place where they should bo buried, but
what they themselves bought for a sum of money : “ And will
you, O ye persecutore, upon the mere promise of the land
made to your fathers, be so confident as to persuade yourselves
it will be your abiding place for ever ’Ξ and that, howsoever
you behave yourselves towards God, you cannot bc removed

for α sum of money. Thus far is no difficulty, when the dis·-
course is of the burial of Jacob in the cave of Machpelah,
but the knot is in the following words, παρὰ τῶν υἱῶν Ἐμμὸρ

the text is not interpolated (as Beza and Heinsius would
have it.) appears from the universal consent both of tho
copies and the translations. For those that would have it

the difficulty lies. So also, as to that clause, other versions
have it.

Now, as to what is objected, let us take it in the words of

Israel, saying that they took it by force and rapine? The
places are these, the cave of Machpelah, the house of the
sanctuary, and the sepulchre of J oscph. The cave of Mach-
pelah, as it is written, ‘ And Abraham hearkened to Ephron,
and weighed to Ephron‚' &c. Gen. xxiii. 16. The house of the
