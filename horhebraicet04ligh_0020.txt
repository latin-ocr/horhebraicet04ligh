ῘΙ. lt is supposed lawful fm- any one to have walt-ed upon
the sabbath day, not only from the outmost boi-der of the
camp to the tabernacle, but also through the whole. camp
from one end of it to the other; because the whole. eneamp-
ing was of one and the same, and not a diverse jurisdictiou.
According to that known canon concerning ΠἾἾΒΠ :ww
comme'm'on or comnz'zmr’on qfcourts. And hence it is that Mai-
monides makes such mention of twelve miles, and the lawful-
ness of walking on the sabbath day through any city, be it as
spacious as Nineveh itself.

ΙΙΙ. But when the people were disposed of, and placed iu
their several cities and towns in the land of (slanaam and t-he
face of things quite changed from what it had been in the
wilderness, it seenied good to the wise men to circumscribe
the space of α sabbath ‹lay'sjournqy within the bounds of two
thousand cubits. And that partly because the imno-st bot-ders
of the Israelites⁷ tents were so much distant from the taber-
nacle, as may be gathered from Josh. iii. 4: and partly because
it. is said, Num. xxxv. 4, 5, “ From the wall of the city yc shall
measure a thousand cubits; and from without the city ye shall
measure two thousand cubits.’' Nowa, “ a thousand cubits are
the suburbs ef the city, and two thousand cubits arc the bounds
of the sabbath.”

IV. As to these words therefore of the evangelist new be-
fore ne, we must suppose they do not define the exact dis-
tance of the mount of Olives from Jerusalem, which indeed
was but five fl11·longsb; nor do they take in the town of
Bethany within the bounds of the sabbath, which was distant
fifteen furlongs, John xi. 18 : but they point out that place of
the mount where our Saviour ascended into heaven. viz. that
place where that tract of the mount of Olives ceased to be
called Βθίῖψῖιαρθ, and began to be called Bethany. Con-
cerning which we have discoursed mere largely in another
place.
