Διάκρισις πνευμάτων, discerniny of spirits, was the judging

· between magioal and diabolical spirits, and their operations‚

and between the operations and speech of the Holy Ghost.
For many salse prophets had at that time gone out into the
world, 1 John iv. 1; and that κατ’ ἐνέργειαν τοῦ Σατανᾶ ἐν

so that it was not easy, l had almost said it was impossible, to
distinguish between their wonders and the true miracles os
the Holy Ghost. But the most meroiful God taking pity
upon his people, among other gifts of the Holy Ghost shedi
abroad for the edification of the ohureh, granted this also to
some, that they might distinguish of prophetioal spirits, whe-
ther they were true and divine, or false and diabolical. That
this deep reach is pointed out under this word κυβερνήσεις,
the apostle's order, the signification of the word, and the
thing itself, do not a little persuade. For when, among all
the gifts of the Spirit, there was searce any either more useful
or more necessary than this judyingr of spirits,- I think he
would hardly omit it in his second enumeration. But where
will you find the mention of it if not in that word?
