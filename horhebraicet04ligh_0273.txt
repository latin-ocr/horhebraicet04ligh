things be done to edification.'' But suppose that which
we suppose of the Hebrew language‚ and the thing will suit
well.

This our most holy apostle saith of himself, chap. ix. 20,
“ Unto the Jews I became as a J eW‚ that I might gain the
Jews ;” which seems here to be done by him: but neither
here nor any where else unless for edification‚ and that he
might gain them. They would not be weaned from the old
custom of the synagogue as to the use of the Hebrew tongue
in their worship, and for the present he indulges them their
fancy; and this not vainly, since by the use of that tongue
the hearers might be edified‚ a faithful interpreter standing
by; which in other languages could not be done any thing
more than if all were uttered in the Corinthian language.

“ If any speak in a tongue, let it be by two,” &c. Let
one read the Scripture in the Hebrew language, let another
pray‚ let a third preach. For according to these kinds of
divine worship you will best divide the persons, that all may
not do the same thing.

Ver. 290: Προφῆται δὲ δύο ἢ τρεῖς λαλείτωσαν· Let the pro-
phets speak two or three] Let 0110 sing, who ‘ hath a psalm ;'
let another teach, who ‘ hath a doctrine ς’ and if a third hath
‘ exhortation 01· comfort‚' as ver, 3, let him also utter it.

Ver. 30 ε Ἐὰν δὲ ἄλλῳ ἀποκαλυφθῇ καθημένῳ· If any
thiny be revealed to another that sittetlz by] That is very fre-
quently said of the Jewish doctors, ΞἮἸἿ ΠἿΠ He sat .· which
means not so much this barely, he was sittiny, as lm tauykt out
of the seat qs the teat-her, or he sat teachiny, 01 ready to teack.
So that indeed he sat and he tauyht are all one. Examples
among the Tahnudists are infinite. In the same sense the
apostle: “ If something be revealed to some minister who hath
a seat· among those that teach, 850„ not revealed in that very
instant; but if he saith, that he hath received some revelation
from God, then ὁ πρῶτος σιγάτω, let the first be silent ‚· let him
be silent that ‘ hath a psalm‚’ and give way to him.’'

Ver. 35: Αἶσχρὸν ’γάρ ἐστι γυναιξὶν ἐν ἐκκλησίᾳ λαλεῖν· For
it is α skama for women to speak in the charoli] Compare
