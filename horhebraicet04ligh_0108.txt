Ver.40: Φίλιππος δὲ εὑρέθη εἰς ’Ἄζωτον But Phe'l‘e'p was
found at Axomis] If this was done at Gaza or near it, it was
from thence to *4:011ch about two hundred and seventy fur-
longse 3 or thirty-four miles, or thereabout. And Azotus was,
as it seems, two miles from Jamnia, according to the compu-
tation of Antoninus's itinerarium. From Gaza to Askalon
sixteen miles; from Askalon to J amnia twenty. W e have
the mention of one &2⁸52 ἾΞἾ Babba Philippi, as it should

CHA P. IX.

Ver. 2: Ἠιτήσατο παρ’ αὐτοῦ ἐπιστολὰς εἰς Δαμασκόν· He
desired of kim [the high priest] letters to Damascus] These
letters were written from the whole Sanhedrim g, the head of
which was Gamaliel, Paul's master3 yet they are attributed
to the high priest, he being of a more worthy degree and
order than the president of the council. That in Acts xxiii. 4
hath a peculial* emphasis, τὸν ἀρχιερέα τοῦ Θεοῦ, God's 11ῑίαᾶ
priest; and hints to us the opinion that nation had of the
high priest, namely, that he was ‘ God's officer :² whereas the
president of the council was only an offieer of the people, and
chosen by men. The charge of the high priest was to take
care about holy things: the charge of the president was to
take care about the traditions: for he was the ³7:27& the
keeper aml rrssository of traditions.

Buth the words we are upon do occasion a more knotty
and difficult question, viz, whether the deerees of the San-
hedrim were of authority amongst the Jews in eountries
abroadff As to Damascus, there is the less scruple ; because
Syria in very many things was looked upon to be of the same
rank and condition with the land of Israel. But what shall
we think of more remote countries? For instance, Egypt or
Babylon, where the greatest number of Jews above all other
countries in the world did reside.

1. There was no Sanhedrim of seventy men, either in
Egypt or Babylon, or indeed anywhere else but that at Jeru-
salem. There were very famous aeademies in Babylon, viz.
that of Nehardea, that of Sora-h, and that of Pombedit-ha3
