Ver. 25: ’Ev μακέλλῳ· In the skamblea] The Gemaristsr
treat of a question not differing much from this which the
apost-le here treats of; namely, how far it is lawful to buy
flesh in the shambles, and that from a heathen, where there

liberty of the gospel abolished as to one's own conscience,
with this proviso, that no scandal or offence be cast before
another man's weak and staggering conscience.
