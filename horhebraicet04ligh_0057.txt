Ver. 6 : Συνέστειλαν αὐτὸν, διο. lVozmd kim up, ⁴:3⁶0] They
having no 3³2*an bzwyz'ny cloths at hand do bind up the dead
man in what fashion they can 3 and, carrying him out of that
place, commit him to the earth.

Ver. 7: ‘529 ὡρῶν τριῶν διάστημα· About the space of three
homa] So long a space of time being spent for interl-ing the
deceased, (loth seem to hint something as to the distance of
the buryingplace3 which in the cities of the Levites we have
thus described: ‘⁶ The suburbical lands for the Levitical cities
are defined in the law to be three thousand cubits from the
wall of each side outward. According as it is said, ‘ From
the wall of the city and outward‚ a thousand cubitsss And it
is elsewhere said, ‘ Ye shall measure from without the city, on
the east side, two thousand cubits.' The thousand cubits are
the suburbs of the city3 and those two thousand which they
measure beyond those are for fields and vineyards. Now
they assign the buryingplace for each city beyond all these
bounds; because they do not bury their dead within the
limits of the citym.’' The buryingplace from a Levitical city
was above a mile and a half distant. Was it so in other
cities‚ that belonged not to the Levites? (loubtless burying-
places were at some distance from all cities3 but whether so
far, may be inquired, but must not be the matter of our pre-
sent search.

Μὴ εἰδυῖα τὸ γεγονός· Not knowiny what was dona] Hence,
probably, we may gather the reason why the word συνέστει-
λαν, they wozmd kim up, is added. Had the deceased been
carried to his own house or lodgings by them who brought
him out of the chamber‚ where he fell down dead, to fetch
buryingcloths, his wife could. not have been ignorant of what
had fallen out: but συνέστειλαν αὐτὸν, they wozmcl him up, as
well as they could in his own clothes, and so carried him out
and buried him.
