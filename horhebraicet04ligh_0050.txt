Ver. 6: Ἰωάνυηιν· John] If we may render ἐκ γένους ἀρχιε-
ρατικοῦ with the Vulgar, em yenere sacerdotali, and especially
with the Syriae and Arabic, oftlee stock (gf the priests, Ι would,
without any stickling, conceive this John here mentioned to be
no other than Rabban J ochanan Ben Zaccai3 because at that
time there was not any one more famous throughout the
whole nation3 and he was of the stock of the priests.

‘⁶ Rabbanp Jochanan Ben Zaccai the priest lived a hun-
dred and twenty years, &c He found favour in the eyes of
Caesar: from whom he obtained Jafneh, and his wiso men,
and physicians that cured R. Zadok. r} ‚471211 DD'OE’D

About that very time which we now have under consideration,
we have this passage related concerning him: ‘⁶ F orty (1 years
before the destruction of the city, when the gates of the
temple flew open of their own accord. Rabban Jochanan Ben
Zaccai said, ‘O temple, temple, why dost thou disturb thy-
self? I know thy end, that thou shalt be destroyed3 for so
the prophet Zachary hath spoken eoncerning thee, Open thy
doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars’ ’'

Her saw the flames of the city and of the temple: and
having obtained from the emperor Titus that the Sanhedrim
might be settled at Jabneh, he presided there two or five
years 3 for the certain number is not agreed upon.

All that can be objected against this Jochanan Ben Zaccai
being the John mentioned in this place seems to be this, that
if this was an assembly of priests, leavened with the leave-n of
the Sadducees‚ (as may be conjectured out of cliap. v. 17‚)
then this Jochanan Ben Zaccai ought not to be reckoned
amongst thcm; for he both lived and died a Phari-see, at
least not a Sadducee: but if tho whole Sanhedrim is to be
understood here, wherein the priests, as much as they were
capable, would strongthen their own party, then would 1 look
sor no other ‚John than this son of Zaccai.
