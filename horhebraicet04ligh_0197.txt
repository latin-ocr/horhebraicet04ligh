himself, and he makes himself a little tent for his food. The
mourner is bound to the rending of his garment ; the excom-
municate not. The mourner is forbid to do any work3 to the
excommunicate it is allowed. The mourner is forbid to wash
himself? to the excommunicate it is allowed. The mourner
put-teth not on sandals; the excommunicate puts them on.
The mourner lies not with his wife 3 the excommunicate lies
with his? 850.

From what hath been said, it seems that it may be 0011-
cluded on one part that excommmvication among the Jews
scarcely sounded the same with (lelz'veriny to 86!th and
there are some reasons also by which it seems it may be con-
cluded in like manner, that (leliverinq to *Satan here in the
apostle doth not sound the same with excommzmicatiou. Bef
it granted that he is excommunicated and cast out of the
chumh, is rejected also by God, and is indeed delivered into
the hands of Satan 3 this is not that which is our task at pre-
sent to consider3 but whether Paul by his let him be cleli-
vered to Satan, or the Corinthians by that expression, under-
stood excommu-nieatfion. We embrace the negative for these
reasons :—

I. Because no reason can be rendered why the apostle‚ re-
jecting the vulgar and most known word ore-0122mfzmicationf,
should fly to another that was very unknown, very obscure.

II. The act of this wicked wretch was above exconmmm'-
cablon. And it was a small matter for such an impious man
to be excominunicated. He deserved death, as we have ob-
served, two or three times over. And it was more agreeable
to that extraordinary wickedness‚ that it should have some
more extraordinary punishment inflicted 011 it than that very

ο common one of excommunication.

III. Why should the apostle use such earnest counsel and
exhortation to excite the church to excommunicate one that
so deserved eoecommunication ? Was exconmn'zmicatz‘on a thing
so difficult to be obtained among them? What. need was there
of the presence of St. Paul's spirit in a thing any ministers of
the church were empowered to do? What need was there of
such solemn determination (ἤδη κέκρικα,ι Ι have determi‘necl
