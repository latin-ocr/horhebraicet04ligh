according to his own form, that is, according to the literal
sound: for example, :2³ss ²73?- ΠΞᾌΠἿῆζῬ Exod. xxiii. 23 he
that interprets that thus, ΠΞἾἻ 172⁷ ἾἿΠῦΠ NL> Thou shall
not testffy ccyac‘nst judglment, is a liar: for he commands that
judgment be brought forth into light. But let him so inter-
pret it, Thou shalt not restrain thyself from teaehing any
that inquire of thee in judgment. So Onkelos renders it..”

“ If he add any thing to it :]—-If he say, ‘Because liberty
is given to add sornewhat, Ι will add wheresoever it lists me 3'
he sets Grod at nought and changeth his words. For where-
soever Onkelos added, he added not of his own sense. For
the Targum was given in mount Sinai, and when they forgot
it, he came and restored it. And Rab.Ohananeel explains
those words, ‘ He that interprets a verse according to his own
form,” by this example, ltffiss'w* ὟΠζῖζξξἿΠζζέ ἸΝἾἾ Exod.

So great a work do they reckon it to: interpret the sacred
text. And these things which have been said perhaps will
afford some light about the gift of interpretation.

But although the use of the Hebrew tongue among these
ministers was so profitable and necessary, yet there was some
abuse which the apostle chastiseth3 namely, that they used
it not to edification and without an interpreter. And fur—
ther, while I behold the thing more closely, Ι suspect them to
J udaize in this matter, which we have before observed them
to have done in other things 3 and that they retained the use
of the Hebrew language in the ehurch‚ although unknown to
the common people, and followed tho custom of the syna-
gogue. Where‚

as we believe, in the synagogucs even of the lIellenists: as we
