they speak much finer in one country than in another. For
as to those words Gen. xxxi. 52, Πτζῑ ἰῗζιζῖ 'ip Tlm‘s lamp be

witness, Onkelos renclers them ΓἻΠ Nau-5 ἾἾΓῙΞ, when
Laban saith &5³³7le Ἶλῗ. But now we must say that

Laban spoke 'Uno ζἾζζῖῖἸ ‘in the Syriae ton-que, which is so
called from Syria. Now Syria was Aram Naharaim, and
Aram Zobah, which David subdued. And because that is
nearer to the land of Israel, the Arotmean language of it is
not so‘pure.” Gloss in Sotahe .· “The Syriae tongue is near
akin to the Ammean. And Ι say that that is the language of
the Jerusalem Talnmd.”

We see, secondly, that the Syriae was the mother tongue
of the land of Israel, and the Aramecm, which is almost the
same, was that of Babylon rather than the Greek or Persic,
which were more elegant; nay, rather than the holy lan-
guage, which was the noblest of all: and that (as to the holy
language) for a reason very obvious, viz. that it was every-
where lost as to common use, and was generally unknown.
As to the two other languages, why they were not in use, the
Gloss gives the reason3 which we have also given us else-
where: “f-rm& 37? ’05³0 {WDKD ἾΓΓ* ἶῖδξ Lest the Syriae
tonfyzae should be vile in thane eyes.’' [Bereslcitla Babba, by a
mistake of the printer‚ hath ³:50 the Persio, instead of *0550
tlte Syriam] ‘⁶ F or, behold, God doth give it honour in the
Law, in the Propheta and in the Hagiographa. In the Law,
for it is said, ΝῙΤἾῆἾῖ-Ἶζῖ] *127 The lamp of witness, Gen. xxxi.

tlte chaldeam spem-e to the May ‘in Syriae, Dan. ii. 4.⁵’ ⁵

The Syriae, therefore, or the Aramecm tongue under the
second temple, was that which went under the name of the
Hebrew tongue‚ that is, the language beyond the river: whence
they were at that time called Ηεόνθτυε, upon the account of
the common use of that tongue. But whether all to whom
that was their mother-tongue were called Hebrews may be a
little questioned τ and for what¹ reasons it may be SO, Ι shall
show after I have said something concerning the fflllenists.
