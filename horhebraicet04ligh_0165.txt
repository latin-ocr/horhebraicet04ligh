Ver. 22: Πᾶσα ἡ κτίσις συστενάζει, 816. The whole crecction
qroaozeth toyetlcer, 28⁶0] If it be inquired how the Gentile world
groaned and travailed in pain, let them who expound this of
the fabric of the material world tell us how {leat groaneth
and travaileth. They must needs own it to be a borrowed
and allusive phrase. ⁴ But in the sense which we have pitched
upon, the very literal construction may be admitted.

C HAP. XI.

BEFORE we apply ourselves to the exposition of this chapter,
let me make these few inquiries:

Ι. Whether the J ewish nation‚ as to the more general and
greater part of it, had not been rejected and blinded before
such time as our Saviour manifested himself in 1116 Η6811Ξ Ι
know well enough that the casting off of that nation is 60111-
monly assigned to that horrid wickedness of theirs in mur-
dering the Lord Christ, and persecuting the gospel and 1118
apostles; a wickedness abundantly deserving their rejection
indeed ε 11111 were they not blinded and cast off before? They
were γευνήματα ἐχιδνῶν, α fyeneration ofeipers, at the time
that the Baptist first appeared amongst them 3 and this bears
the same signification as ‘ the seed of the serpent.7

Our Saviour preacheth to them in parables, ‘⁶ that they
might neither see, nor hear, nor be converted, nor their 81118
116 forgiven them‚” Mark iv. ΙΙ, 12 : which may give ground
of suspicion that that people were cast off, to whom Christ
preaches in such a form and manner of orator-y on purpose
that “ they should not be converted.”

Ifk they were Jews to whom St. Peter directs his First
Epistle, (as who indeed doth deny 11ἓ) 111611 there is some
weight in those words, chap. ii. 10, ‘⁴ Y e were in times past
not a people.''

ΙΙ. Ι8 11 1101 very agreeable to reason and Scripture to sup-
pose that nation cast off for 1116 entertainment they had
given to their ‘fond and impious traditions3 A reprobate
people certainly they were, whose religion had made void the
commandments of God : a reprobate nation, who in vain wor-
shipped God after 1116 commandments of men, Matt. xv3 and
by such commandments of men which had leavened, yea, poi-

k Leusden’s edition, vol. ii. p. 877.
