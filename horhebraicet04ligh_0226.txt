Vm. 1: Οὐκ εἰμὶ ἐλεύθερος; Am I ποί-11669] Here some
interpretem in their versions vary the order of the clauses,
and read, Am I not five ,9 and then after that, *⁶ Am I not an
a1)ostle3” moved to it hence undoubtedly, because it is greater
to be an apostle than to be free.- and they supposed they
should keep true order if they proceeded from a lower degree
1ο a highen But they should have considered that Paul did
not barely treat of Christian liberty, but of apostolic liberty:
which appears also sufficiently, ver. 5. Nor could he 1180 11

himself an apostle‚ and then proving his apostolic libert-y.

He is about 10 treat of his liberty, or how lawful it is for

tithes were not to be required and taken of the Gentiles;
maintenance was not to be asked from heathens ; and that a

power among 1110111 who had raised a (lifference against him
about this business, ver. 3 : “ Be it granted that it was
appointed by the traditioual laws concerning taking no main-

I am free from such laws3 yea it is in my power to institute
