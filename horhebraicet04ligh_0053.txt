too, as that when it shows that ‘¹ they said among thom-
selves, This is the heir‚” &c.‚ it may intimate, that the chief
of the Jews, who condemned and crucified the Lord JesuS,
knew him to have been the Messiah?

ΤΟ proceed in the historiam, Ἐφάυη αὐτοῖς τρίτηι· ἕχωυ ἡμέραν
πάλιν ζῶν· He appeared to them (his disciples)‚ leaving] revivat tlte
third day. Let us but consult Matt. xxviii. 13—-I5, and see
if there can be any doubt whether the priests and fathers of
the Sanhedrim were not convinced and persuaded that J esus
had indeed arose from the dead, when they did, so knowingly
and industriously‚ devise a tale to elude his resurrection.
Thus far, therefore, Josephus (if it was he indeed that was
the author os that passage) hath uttered nothing but what
the rulers themselves were conscious of, if they would have
spoken out: but what is added in him, τῶυ θειῶυ προφητῶν

where the prophet discourseth about the Messiah‚ “that he
shall be cut off 3 that he shall cause the sacrifice and the
oblation to cease; that the people oftlce prime that shall come
[i. e, the Romans] shall destroy the city and sanctuary3”
Whence it may very probably be argued, that they, both from
the agreement of times and from the miracles and doctrine
of J esus, did more than suspect that this was the Messiah of
whom the prophet had there discoursed, and that they were
in great doubt what to do with him. “ This man doth many
miracles, and demonstrates himself to be the Messiah3 and
what shall we do ἒ To cut off the Messiah would be a horrid
thing: and yet, on the other hand, if we should suffer him, he
