Ch. xvi. 22.] Eaeeroitations upon ι Epist. Corinth. Q85

IV. Hitherc I, or rather doth the apostle, bring those
words of Isaiah, chap. lxv. 15, “Ye shall leave your name
for a curse unto my chosen.” Hither also may be brought
that of Malachi‚ chap. iv.‚ wherewith the Old Testament is
concluded‚ ΞἾΠ vatem-n& *fram &HN-{D Lest I come
and smite the land vitlo (anathema) a curse. Les( I come.- this
is the same with that which the apostle saith, Maran- atha,
the Lorcl comem. And I will smila with anathema, the same
with that in this verse, Lat kim be anathema. Against whom
is the threatening in the prophet? Against the unbelieving
Jews. Against the same -is both the threatening and curse
os the apostle, taken (methinks) out of the very words of the
prophet.

And now you may easily fetch out the sense of the word
Marma-atha. The holy Scripture speaks great and terrible
things concerning the coming] of Christ to punish the nation of
the Jews, for their not loz-inq, yea, hating Christ, and treading
the gospel under foot. It is called his ‘ coming] in his king-
dom, in the clouds, in glory ε’ which we observe elsewhere.
So that I should much more readily interpret this expression
Marma-ama, that is, our Lorcl comella, in this sense, from this
common manner of speech, and which is so very usual to the
Scripture, than to run to I know not what Jewish form; which
yet is not at all to be met with among the J ewsd.
