VER. 1: Καὶ ἐν τῷ συμπληροῦσθαι τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς Πευ-
τηκοστῆς· And when the day of Pentecost was fully come]
I. This word pentecost seems to be taken into use by the
Hellenist Jews to signify this feast ; which also almost all the
versions retain, the Western especially, and, amongst the
Eastern, the Syriae and Ethiopic. The Hebraizing Jews
commonly call this feast by the name of Πῆῖῃς from which
one of the Arabic translations differs very little, when it
renders it in this place '‘JZDDULJN ΠἚΞΞ] 1²5& mm where
the letter Ξ is only inserted3 the other omits the word wholly,
und only hath ΓῖζΠΞΠίἳξέ DT', 1¹!ae day fftltefifty.

ΙΙυ It is well enough known that Πῖἲξῖ, in the holy Scrip-
tures, was a holz'day, Levit. xxiii. 36 3 Dent. xvi. ὃς 2 Kings
x. 20: and the reason why the Jews so peculiarly appro-
priate it to the feast of Pentecost seems to be this3 because
this feast consisted in one solemn day, whereas the feast of
Passover and of Tabernacles had more (lays. ‘⁶ As Ζ the (lays
of the feast are seven. R. Chaija saith, ‘ Because tho Pente-
cost is but for one day, is the morning so too ‘3’ They say
unto him, ‘Thou arguest from a far-fetched tradition.”' Where
the Gloss hath it, ⁶⁶ That this fast is but for one (lay, we learn
from the very word 1²⁹me “ The a men of the town Ma-
haesia are strong of heart, for they see the glory of the law
twice in the year.'' The Gloss is, “ Thither all Israel is
gathered together in the month Adar5 that they may hear
the traditions concerning that passover in the school of Rabh
Asai: and in the month Elul, that they may hear the tra-
ditions concerning the feast of Tabernacles. But they were
not so gathmed together 7³7& mv &zm *mmm new:
at the feast of Pentecost, because that is not above one (lay.'’

Hence that Baithusean may be the better believed in his
dispute with Rabban J ohananb, “Moses our master (saith
he) will love Israe13 &³17 737& Dr nwssytv 37-er and loe
