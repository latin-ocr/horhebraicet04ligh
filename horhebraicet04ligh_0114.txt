the torments of the belly, and suppressing the cause: and
that (as it should seem) not only to conceal the king’s re-
pmach, but to add something of honour to him. For lay that
passage in the Tahnud to this, ’ἰῗἹΠΞ amr: 0⁸17*OE 3712.) ῙἎἸἾ

On the contrary, to be devoured by worms was reekoned an
aceursed thing, and what befell none but rnen of greatest im-
piety. Thosee that went to spy out the land of promise,
and raised an evil repert upon it, “ they had their tongues
hanging out, and falling upon their navels3 ΠἾὩῖῚἾΠ ῬΠ

crept into their navels, and issued out of their navels again,
and crept into their tongues.” “ A certain priest’' (a Bai-

VER. 1: Ἦσαν δέ τινες ἐν Ἀντιοχείᾳ κατὰ τὴν οὖσαν ἐκ·
κλησίαυ· lere were some in the chamolt that was at Antioch]
Compare that passage, chap. xi. 27, with this plaee3 and
neither the word τίνες, some, will seem redundant, nor the
phrase κατὰ τὴν οὖσαν ἐκκλησίαν so harsh. ‘⁸ There came some
prophets from Jerusalem to Antioeh,'’ when yet there were
in the church of Antioch some prophets of their own already.
And it seems to hint that the separation of Paul and Bar-
nabas to the ministry was done by the stated ministers of
that church, and not by others that came thither.

Προφῆται καὶ διδάσκαλοι· Propheta· and teachers g.] These
offices, indeed, are distinguished 1 Cor. xii. 28 and Eph.
iv. 11 ι but here they seem as if they were not so to be. For
the church of Antioch was not yet arrived at that maturity
that it should produce teachers that were not endowed with
the Holy Ghost and the gift of prophecy, and the phrase
κατὰ τὴν οὖσαν ἐκκλησίαν seems to intimate some such thing3
viz. that according) to tlte state of the elaurch then bein-(7 in that
place, there were, nay it was necessary there should be, pro-
