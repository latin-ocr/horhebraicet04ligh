124 Hebrew (md Talmmlical [Ch. xiv. 6.

ΙΙ. Let us inquire whether the apostles and the Christian
church did not now observe and celebrate the Lord’s day. It
can hardly be (leniod ; and if so, then judge whether the apo-
stles might not invite the Gentiles that they would assemble
again the next day, that is, upon the Christian sabbath, and
hear these things again. If we yield that the Lord’s day is
to be called the sabbath, then we shall easily yield that it
might be rightly called μεταξὺ σάββατον, the sabbath after.
And indeed, when the speech was amongst the Jews οι·
J udaizing proselytes, it is no wonder if it were called the sab-
bath. As if the apostles had said, ‘ T o-morrow we celebrate
our sabbath; and will you on that (lay λαληθῆναι τὰ ῥήματα,
have these words preacleecb to you ,θ’

III. Or let τὸ μεταξὺ σάββατον be tlte πεζή betwiaet the two
sabbaths3 as that expression must be rendered νησῖεύω δὶς τοῦ
σαββάτου, Ifast twice ita {lm weda then, as the sense is easy,
that they besought them the same things might be repeated
on the following week, so the respect might have more parti-
cularly been had to the second and fifth days in the week,
when they usually met together in the synagogue.

VER. 6: Εἰς τὰς πόλεις τῆς Λυκαονίας, Λύστραν καὶ Δέρβην·
To Lystra and Derbe, citios of Lycaonia] Strabo tells us
expressly that Iconium also was within Lycaoniau ς “ Thence
are the Lycaonian hills plain, cold, naked‚ and pastures for
wild asses, &c. There are also the lakes, the greater called
Coralis, the less called Trogitis. Ἐνταῦθα ὃέ που καὶ τὸ Ἰκό-
νιόν ἐστιν· About those places stands leonium, a town built in a
better soil than what Ι mentioned as the pastui-e of wild
asses.'' Ptolemy also places Iconium in Lycaonia-v. IIow
comes it to pass then that St. Luke deth not call Ironizcm a
city of Lycaonia, as well as Derbe y and Lysim? Because
leonium was of something a distinct jurisdiction. “ Datur et
tetrarchia cx Lycaoniazss' &c “There is also granted a
tetrarehy out of Lycaonia, on that side that bounds upon
Galatia, consisting of fourteon citios, the most famous of
which is Iconium.''
