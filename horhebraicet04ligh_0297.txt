Tnfflm the seat of the ten tribes by the light of the
Scriptnres and the Talmudists, we find they were placed in
Assyria, and Babylon, and the borde1·ing eountries3 disposed
under their captivity in those very lands wherein the divine
eounsel had deereed the two tribes also should be disposed,
when they should undergo the same lot: that those tribes
which had bordered upon each other in their own land, should
border also upon each other in a strange land: and that
they, whom God had united in the promise of their future
eall, should be also united in the same habitations, that they
might be called together.

These that were carried away from their own land, “the
king of Assyria placed in Halaeh and Chabor, near the river
Gozan, and in the eities of the Medes‚’' 2 Kings xvii. 6, and
xviii. 11.

The Talmudists do thus comment upon the places named :
“ R. Abbaf Bar Chana saith,
