that he, eleaving to Peter before, who was the minister of
the eireumeision, liked not what these ministers of the uneir-
eumeision did among the Gentiles 3 but being better informed
asterward, returned again to Paul. So also these Corinthians,
and indeed all the Jews everywhere that. were eonverted, too
much J udaizing as yet, how much more readily would they
give up their names to that famous minister of eireumeision,
than to the minister or ininisters of uneireumeision? But
why not to James or to John, 11110 were as much ministers
of eireumeision ἓ

the door, and bring in the gospel among the Gentiles. Taking
all these observations together, it is no wonder if these Co-
rinthian Jews, ‚Judaizing in very many other things, as appears
from this Epistle, when they were minded to enrol themselves

themselves under Peter, the apostle of 6116111116151011, rather
than under Paul, the minister of the Gentiles3 under Peter,
an apostle out of the land, rather than under James, who was
