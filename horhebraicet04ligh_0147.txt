Ch. xxiii. 8.] Exercitate'ous upon the A ets. 14]

The Sadducees might learn indeed from the scribes and
Pharisees themselves to give a greater share of honour to
the Pentateuch than the other books, for even they did so 3
but that they should reject them, so at least as not to read
them in their synagogues, there was some other thing that
must have moved them to it.

WVhen Ι take notice of this passages, that “ five of the
elders translated the law into Greek for Ptolemy 3³² and that
in Josephus‘, that ‘⁴ the law only was translated ;’⁷ and both
these before so much as the name or sect of the Sadducees
was known in the world, I begin to suspect the Saddacees‚
especially the Samaritans, might have drawn something from
this example: at least, if that be true that is related by
Aristeas; that he was under an anathema that should add
any thing to or alter any thing in that version. VVheu the
Saddacees therefore would be separating into a sect, having
imbibed that heresy, that there is no resurrectae, and wrested the
words of Antigonus into such a sense, it is less wonder if they
would admit of none but the books of Moses only3 because
there was nothing plainly occurred in them that contradieted
their error: and further, because those aneients of great name
having rendered those five books only into Greek, seem to
have consigned no other for books of a divine stamp. I do
not at all think that all the sadduceos did follow that version,
but Ι suspect that the Samaritans took something from
thence into their own text. It is said by some, in defence
of the Greek version, that in many things it agrees with
the Hebrew text of the Samaritansu, as if that text were
purer than our Hebrew, and that the Greek interpreters
followed that text. They do indeed agree often ; but ifI should
say that the Samaritan text in those placeS, or in some of
them, hath followed the Greek version, and not the Greek
version the Samaritan text, I presume I should not be easily
confuted.

Shall I give you one or two agreements in the very begin-
ning of the Pentateuch. ἲ ln Gen. ii. 2 the Hebrew text is,

ΨᾛἪῘἼ ΕῬΞ Dii-³³7& &PU For Gocl ended his πον] on the
‘seventh day: but the Greek hath it. Και συνετέλεσεν ὁ Θεὸς
