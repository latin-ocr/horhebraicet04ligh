the name οἵ an idol.” For my part} am at a stand in this
matter3 as also in what words the Chaldee paraphrast hath
rendered this clause. For in the books published amongst
us it is ῙὉἾὩὉΠΞ ΠὈΕ) Π“; when as the Aradi, citing the
Targurnist in this place, saith, ΠἾΣΕ) ’ῶἾλἾΠ DDDLJD ΓΠΞΒ

that it was so originally written in the Targumist I do very
much suspect, however Kimchi owns only the other reading, ·

that propriety in this place that it bears in Ezek. xiii. 18

it is the more probable that⁸ he may render 53Ξῖῗὲ in this

word &ji-772, If, therefore, according to the copy quoted by
the Aruclz it should be read ᾎἾΞἾἽΞΓΞἾ, then the Chaldee ver-
sion falls in with thc Greek, and shews that 0:317? should
be rendered your flIoZoclc: so that filoloclz signifies'an idol,-
and Siccam not an idol, but σκηνὴ τοῦ M ολὸχ, the tabernac& of
Molock .· which seems the more likely from the agreement of
the two clauses σκηυὴ τοῦ Μολὸχ and ἄστρον τοῦ Ῥεμφᾰν, the
tabernaclo of Molocli and star of Remplean.

not spend much time to find outk, this having been the busi-
ness of so many pens already; only this I cannot but observe,
that both Moloclz and Remphan were certain figures that
represented some of the celestial luminaries, because he saith
he “ gave them up to worship the host of heaven‚’' ὤας and
that it is generally supposed that by Moloelz was represented
the sun3 partly because of the kingly name, and partly upon
the account of the fiery form and shape of the idol and the
