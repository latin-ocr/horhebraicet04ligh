idolatrous sacrifice were prohibited to vso. Ἀλισγήματα τῶυ
εἰδώλων doubtless comprehended cell thino-5 offered {o iclds, and
perhaps all the utensils too: and it is no impertinent question,
whether that in the epistle commanding them ἀπέχεσθαι εἰὸω-
λοθύτωυ, to abstaz'n from thinys offered to idols, did not restrain
them from the use of all such utensils, as well as from the
eating of things offered.

Καὶ τῆς πορνείας* And from fornication] Any one may
discern how obvious this twofold inquiry is; namely‚ of what
fornication the discourse here is? and for what reason forni-
cation, whatsoever it is, should be reckoned here amongst the
ἀδιάφορα, or inclzffbrent things?

Ι. When Ι recollect what we frequently meet with amongst
the Rabbins, that some things are permitted ΌἾἾ Ὃξῑῖὶ
ΞἸῙἯΠ for peace' salim and some things forbidden ΌἾἻ ὊΞΈ)
ΞἿἿἾἸὩΝ by reason of tlzo oustoms of tlze Amorites, or the Gen-
tiles ‚· I am apt to suspect in these decrees of the apostles there
is some relation to both; that it was permitted to the con-
verted Gentiles to judaize in some things for peace' sake;
but to abstain in other, not that they might not judaize‚ but
that they might not do as the heathen.

ΙΙ. Particularly in this prohibition of fornication, we must
consider that it is not so proper to think there needed any
peculiar command or prescript of the apostles to those that
had embraced Christianity against fornication, in the common
notion and acceptation of the word, whereas the whole tenor
of the gospel prescribed against it. And for that very reason
I cannot persuade myself that by blood forbidden in this place
we are to understand murder.

III. There was a certain fornication among-st the Jews that
seemed to them lawfuL and had some colour of legitimation z
this was polygamy, Hos. iv. 103 ³252*- 8237] 22]ch leey shall
commit wlzoredom, aad shall not increase : so the Chaldee and
Syriae and our own translation render it well. But now for-
nication, as it denotes whoredom, doth not wish or expect any
offspring‚ but the contrary rather: but the words relate to
bigamy or polygamy. For in case of the wife’s barrenness, it
was a common thing for them to take to them another
