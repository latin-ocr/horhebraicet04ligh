Ver. 2 : Πρὸς τὴν θύραν τοῦ ἱεροῦ τὴν λεγομένην (Ωραίαιν At
the φατε of the temple which ‘is called Beacctzfzd] ⁴ Here I am at
a stand as to the determination of this gate, according to the
uncertain signification of the word ὡραίαν. If in the etymo-
logy of it, it bath any relation with ὥρα, time, (which any one
would imagine) then we might suppose it the gate called
U'Ilffirl [Iulclalm perhaps so called from ἿῙὮΠ Hostem, time, or
aye. There were two gates of this name on the south side of
the court of the Gentiles, under that noble porch called the
βασιλικὴ, or νομαί lun-clay,- through which the way led from
Jerusalem itself, or Aera, into the Temple. But if by ὡραίαν
be meant strictly beautiful, as it is commonly rendered, then
we might suppose it the east gate of the Vv⁷ome1ss Gourt:
which although it was but a brazen gate. yet for splendour
and glittering it exceeded the other gates of silver or gold.
“ There were nine of the gates indeed that were overlaid with
silver and gold. But one without the temple made of Corin-
thian brass, which far exceeded those of gold οι· silver2.’'

Let the reader judge, whether that which is added ver. 11
increase or explain the difficulty: ‘⁶ As the lame man which
was healed held Peter and J olm, all the peoplc ran together
unto them in the porch which is called ‘ Solomon'sf '³ From
whence this difficulty ariseth : Whether Peter and John and
the lame man had hitherto gone no further than the Court of
the Gentiles; or whether they had come back thither from
the Women's Court. If the former, then the lame man lay at
some gate of the court of the Gentiles that was called Ὠραία,
which we may suppose was the gate called Haldah: if the
latter, then he lay at that Corinthian gate.
