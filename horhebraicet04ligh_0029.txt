Roslz Haskanalzf; “ R. Oshaiah saith, ‘ Whence comcs it that
ΠἾΒῺ the Pentecost hath ἷἾῃἾίῗῐυΠ compensations for all the

He compares the feast of weeks (i. e. Pentecost) with the
feast of unleavened bread. That hath compensations for all

the seven days ’ἴ ³7: ΓὈἹῖἬζΞῙἿ *¹³7 w* ΠἿὩἾΞΨΓἼ λΓῐ 5²1&
so the feast of weeks (i. e. Pentecost) laath compensatam for all
clm seven days.” They called that ΓΌῚῐἮυΠ compmzsaz‘ions,
when any one not having made his just offerings in the be-
ginning of the feast, repaired and compensated this negligence
or defect of his by offering in any other of the seveng days.
And thus much may suffice as to this whole feast in general.
Now as to the very (lay of Pentecost itself, it may not be
amiss to add something.

I. It is well known that the account of weeks and days
from the Passover to pentecost took its beginning from, and
depended upon, the day of offering the sheaf of the first-
fruits, Levit. xxiii. 15. But through the ambiguity of the
phrase navt] ΠἾΠᾨᾯ the marrow of the sabbath, there hath
arisen a controversy betwixt the scribes and Baithuseans,
whether by {be sabbath ought to be understood the weekly
sabbath (or, as the scribes commonly called it, ΓΨΨΝἻΞ, Πζᾞῖἒ,
the sabbath oftlze creation), 01· whether it should be understood
of the sabbatfz'cal day, i.e. the first day of the seven days of
passover, which was the solemn day, Exod. xii. 26. The
Baithuseans contend vehemently for the former, and will not
have the sheaf offered but after the weekly sabbath. As
suppose the first day of the passover should fall out upon the
first day of the week, they would stay till the whole week
with the sabbath day was run out3 and then, on the morrow
of that sabbath, i. e. the first day of the following week, they
offered the sheaf. But the scribes, very differently, keep
strictly to the sixteenth day of the mouth Nisan for offering
the firstfruits without any dispensation, after the sabbatical
day or the first day of the feast is over. And amongst other
arguments by which they strengthen their opinion, those two
