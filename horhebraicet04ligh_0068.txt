62 Hebrew ancl Talmudical [Ch. vi. 1.

Ι. That the Hellenists were Jews, dwelling among the
Gentiles, and not at all skilled in the Hebrew tongue. The
apostle in that division of his, which he so ostentimes useth,
of Ἰουδαῖοι καὶἝλληυες, Jews ancl Greeks, meaning by Greeks
all other nations excepting the Jewish only, speaks chiefly
to the capacity of the vulgar, to whom, by reason of the late
circumjacent empires of the Greeks, that way of expressing
the Gentiles was most known and familiar3 nor perhaps was
it so very safe at that time to have brought in the Romans in
that antithesis.

But may the word Hellenist be taken with that latitude on
the other side, that the phrase may be applied not to the
Jews only who understood nothing but Greek, but to all the
Jews also that did not understand Hebrew? Perhaps the
strict etymology of the word may make something against it;
but should it be granted, it would not be of so absurd a con-
sequence if we do but except the Parthians, Medes, Elamites,
and the rest of those eastern countries who were not of the
Greek or Macedonian, but the Persian and Babylonish cap-
tivity or transmigration. For the very word Hellenist, espe-
cially as it is opposed to Hebrew, seems to intend some such
thing; viZ. that those who are called Hebrews should be those
who were of the captivity and dispersion beyond the ricem
and those that go under the denomination of Hellenists are
those who after their return from this captivity have suffered
some other removal or scattering among the Greek or western
countrics, and understood no other language but os those
count-ries only, having lost the use of what was originally
their native tongue, viz. the Hebrew or Chaldee.

II. As to the Hebraeos, Ι suppose thcrc are hardly any will
deny but that all in general might be so called that used the
Hebrcw as their own mother-tonguc. Nor can I imagine for
what other reason Paul of Tarsus should go under thc de-
nomination of a Ilaebrew, but because the llcbrcw tongue in
his father's family was his mother-tonguc, and thc Greek was
tho mother-tonguc of the place where he was born. But that
we may inquire a little inore strictly into thc peculial· pro-
priety of this title and denomination, let us proponnd this
questi0n,—viz. to whom that Epistle of St. Paul to the Ho-
hrews was particularly written ἲ
