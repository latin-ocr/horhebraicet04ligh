2. lt may further be questioned whether our blessed martyr
was condemned by any formal sentence of the Sanhedrim, or
hurried in a tumultuary manner by the people, and so mur-
dered : it seems to be the latter.

Sanhedrim) in the sepulchres of their fathers. But there are
two places of burial belonging to the Sanhedrim3 one, for
those that are beheaded and strangledg the other, for those
that are stoned and bnrnt.’' The reason why such are not
to be buried with their fathers is this, Dp yww ΓἾΞᾫ phau)
'7³73 because llwy clo not bury the ⁸csm'le‘gs with the ‹innamma- which
they deduce srom the story of an ordinary person cast into
Elisha's grave, who continued not there, but rose again.

“ Theg stone wherewith any one is stoncd‚ the wood 011
which he is hanged, the sword by which he is beheaded, and
the halter wherewith he is etlangled, is still buried in the
same place with him,⁷' or at least very near him. That it
was otherwise with Stephon, the words now before us do
evince3 but whether this was from the i1·1dnlgcnce of the
Sanhedrim towards the condemned person, or because he was
not condemned by the Sanhedrim, let others judge.
