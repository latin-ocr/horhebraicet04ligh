priest, as may be evident from those titles given to Annas and
(laiaplms, Luke iii. 2. Nor doth any thing hinder but that
we may easily suppose that A mzm'as the sagan was in the pos-
session of his saganship at this very time.

Vcr.5: Οὐκ ᾔδειν, ἀδελφοὶ, ὅτι ἐστὶν ἀρχιερεύς· Ι wz'st not,
bretkren„ that he was the Myle priest] I. Suppose he might
not know that man to have been lcz'yk priest, or the saycm,
(which is hardly probable‚) yet he could not be ignorant, from
the rank he held and-the seat he possessed, that he must be
at least oue of the fathers of the Sanhedrim and rulers of the

upon the words before us: ‘⁶ Ι know it is not lawful to speak
evil of the ruler of the people; nor would Ι have said these
things to hixn whieh 1 have, ifI had owned such a one; but
I did not own him so, for he is not worthy the name of a
high priest.”

IV. The president of the Sanhedrim at this time was
Rabban Simeon Ben Gamaliel: his father Ganlaliel having
been dead about two or three years before. Paul knew Si-
meon, and Simeon very well knew him, having been follow-
