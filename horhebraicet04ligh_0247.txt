who was a barber and an astrologer, saw by his astrology
that the Jews would shed his blood,” (which was to be under-
stood of his proselytism, namely, when they circumcised
him.) “ When a certain Jew therefore came to him to have
his hair cut, he cut his throat. And how many throats did
he cut? R. Lazar Ben Jose saith, Eighty. R. Jose Ben R..
Bon saith, Three hundred.”

Ver. ]5 ε ‘H κόμη ἀντὶ περιβολαίου δέδοται· Her· hair ἴε yive‘n
her for α coz-erim] The daughter of Nicodemus being re—
duced to miserable poverty, going to Rabban Jochanan to
speak to him, ΠἻῺΨΠ ΠΒῘΔΞΗὫ “ veiled ¹ herself with laer hair,
and stood before him.” The poor woman had no other veil,
therefore she used that which was given her by nature: and
she used it (shall Ι say as a sign? or) as an instrument and
mark of modesty and shamefacedness.

Ver. 21 : ‘'Exaffros τὸ ἵδιου δεῖπνον προλαμβάνει· Euerg] one
taketlc before other lais own supper] I. I wonder the Affapoe,
the lovefhasts, of which St] ude speaks, ver. 12, should among
interpreters receive their exposition hence. “ In those feasts
(saith Beza) which they call Aqapoe, that they used to take
the holy supper of the Lord, appears from 1 Cor. xi : of which
thing discourse is had in Tertullian's Apologetic‚ chap. xxxix,
and in other writings of the ancients.” So he also speaks at
Acts ii. 42. And upon this place, ‘⁶ The m apostle (saith he)
passeth to another head of this discourse‚ namely, the admi-
nistration of the Lord’s supper, to which the love feasts were
joined‚'' &a And upon the following verse; ‘⁶ The love
feastS, although they had been used a long while in the church
and commendably too, the apostles themselves being the
authors of them, yet the apostle judgeth them to be taken
away because of their abuse.”

So also Baronius ; “The use of a most commendable thing
continued as yet in the church, that as Christ had done at
his last supper, and had admonished his disciples to do in
remembrance of him, Christians meeting in the church should
sup together, and withal should receive the most holy eucha-
rist: which nevertheless when the Corinthians fulfilled not as
they ought, Paul doth deservedly reprove.''
