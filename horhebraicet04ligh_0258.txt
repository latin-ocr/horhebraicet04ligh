Thusd, as in the beginning of the Mosaieal dispensat-ion,
God vindieated the honour of the sabbath by the death os
him that gathered sticks; and the honour of the worship in
the tabernaele by the death of Nadab and Abihu3 and the
honour of his name by the stoning of the blasphemer : so he
set up like monuments of his vengeanee in the beginning of
