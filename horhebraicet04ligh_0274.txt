' ἾἸΞἛ for th} honour of the synagyoyueff' Note that-z it was a
disgrace to the ehureh if a woman should read in it; which
was allowed even to a child, even to a servant: much more
if she usurped any part of the ministerial office. It was also
usual sor one or the other sitting by to ask the teacher of
this or that point : but this also the apostle forbids women3
and that for this reason, “ Because it was not allowed women
to speak, but let them be subject to their husbands‚’' ver. 34.
It was allowed them to answer Amen with others, and to sing
withq the ohurch3 but to speak any thing by themselves, it
was forbidden them.

Vnn. 5: Καὶ ὅτι ὤφθη Κηφᾷ· And that lca was seen of Oe-
plms] Namely, going to Emmaus. See what we have said
at Mark xvi.

Ver. 6: ’Ἔπειτα ὤφθη ἐπάνω πεντακοσίοις ἀδελφοῖς ἐφάπαξ·
After that, ke was seen of above five hundred hrethren at once] “ In
a mount-ain of Galilee‚'⁷ Matth. xxviii. 163 where it is added
by the evangelist, οἱ δὲ ἐδίστασαν, but some doubted, which is
to be warily understood; not that some of the eleven now
still doubted of his resurrection, for Thomas himself had
believed before3 but that some of that multitude, assembled
there with the eleven, doubted. Therefore it is not only eon-
gruous but necessary to render that verse thum “ And they
(t-he eleven disciplcs) seeing him, worshipped him ; but others
doubted.'' Not some of the elevem but others of the com-
pany.

Ver. 7¹: ’Ἑπειτα ὤφθη Ἰακώβῳ· After that, he was seen of
James.] What James? the son of Zebedee, οι· of Alpheus?
lt is more probable to understand it of James tho son of
Alpheum and that he was alive when Paul wrote this; and
that the epostle seems on purpose to treat of tho appearance
of Christ to Peter; and ιῙαηῑαε, the minister of tho circum-
cision3 and to himself, the minister of the uneireumcision.
