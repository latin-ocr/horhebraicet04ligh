cause and reason, ascribed into this peculiar fellowship and
number. As 10 1116 twelve and the seventy we need not in-
quire: as to the rest, leti us see whether it may not be inti-
mated 10 us, ver. 21, that they had been the followers of
Christ, in company with the others, from the very first of his
publishing the gospel.

That Peter should be always at the head of them, and have
the chief parts in the whole history, as their prolocutor and
chief actor, must be attributed,

1. To his seniority, he being older than any of the 011161·
twelve. And whereas, under this notion of his age, he had
been their chief speaker all the while that our Saviour con-
versed amongst them, it· was but just and reasonable he
should hold the same place and quality now that their Lord
was gone.

2. To his repentance. And what was but necessary, that
he who had so scandalously fallen might, by his future zeal
and religion, as much as possible give some considerable testi-
monies both of his repentance and recovery.

3. He was designed to the apostleship of circmncision as
the chief minister: it. was fit thereforek that 116 should 116
chief ainongst those of the circumcision. But when we style
him the chief minister of the circumcision, we do not dream
of any primacy he had over the other ministers of the circuni-
cisi0n; only that the greatest work and the widest space of
that ministry fell to his lot, viz. Mesopotamia, or the Babylo-
nish and Assyrian captivity, namely, the Jews in Babylon, and
the ten tribes mixed with them. And when we speak of him
as acting the chief and principal parts, we do 1101 believe the
rest of the apostles idle; we know they were endowed with
equal authority, an equal gift of miracles, equal number of
tongues, equal wisdom, and an equal power of preaching the
gospel ; but that he, for the reasons above mentioned, had
shown his zeal, industry‚ and activity, in some ways and mea-
sures very extraordinary.
