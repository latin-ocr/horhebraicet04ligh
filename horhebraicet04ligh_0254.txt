248 Hebrew <md 'l'almccdc‘cal [ch. xi. 25.

ἐστι τὸ αἷμά μου, τὸ τῆς καινῆς διαθήκης, This 'is my blood ⁰f the
new testantem : Paul, and Paul's coxnpanion Luke, thus,
Τοῦτο τὸ ποτήριον ἡ καινὴ διαθήκη ἐν τῷ ἐμῷ αἵματι; Tlcis cup ’ἵε
tlze new covenant 'in my blood, to the same sense with the
former, but more explained. And here again let us compare
the sanction of the old covenant, Exod. xxiv.

I. A figurative expression is used in that history, when it
is said, that Moses sprinkled the blood “upon all the people ;''
that is, upon the twelve pillars erected by him to represent
the twelve tribes, ver. 4. So also in this place, “ This is my
blood,’' that is, ¹ the representation of n1y blood.q

H. Ofy the blood then sprinkled it might be said, This is
the blood of Christ, of the old or first testament. The
very blood then and from thence represented the blood of
Christ; because, under the old testament, there was from
time to time to be shedding os blood. But now, wine is a
representation of the blood of Christ3 because thenceforward
the shedding of such kind of blood was to cease.

ΙΙΙ. TheZ old covenant was not established in the blood
of that paschal lamb in Egypt, but in the blood of bulls and
goats in the wilderness. And the reason was, because when
the Passover was instituted, the laws and articles concerning
which the eovenant was entered into had not been promul-
gated: but when they were published and written, then the
covenant was established. In like manner Christ, in the
institution of baptism, established not the new eovenant:
oaptism was ‘ the beginning of the gospel,' Mark i. 1: but
when he had delivered the doctrine and articles of the gospel,
then he established the ‘ new testament.'

Where α testamenii is, there must of necessity be the death of
the testator‚’' &c
