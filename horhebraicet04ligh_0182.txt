the saith oi' the gospel. But how much pains must l'aul take
among the Gentiles, who had not so mueh as ever heard

daily, and, as it were, drop by drop instils inte them the doe-
trine of religion3 and it was no small labour leisurely to lead
them to a baptizable measure of knowledge, if I may have
leave so to express it. He baptized Gaius Crispus, Ste-
phanas, that were Jews who were presently and with little
labem· instrueted in the doctrine of the gospe13 but others,
who did ripen mere slowly to the knowledge of it, he eom-
initted to ether ministers, to be baptized when they should
find them fitted for it.
