Psalm cxviii. 223 Εἳιῆἱέζῐ ἢῦζξᾮ {HN The stone which z‘lw
bailelers rejected, Sco. And are these things said os the Mes-
siah ἒ Surely the Jew will hardly believe his pompous Messiah
should be rejected, and set at nought by his own oountrymen.
And therefore doth St. Peter the more vehemently incul—
eate it; This is the stone. Our Saviour had said before,
Matt. xxi, “Did ye never read in the Scriptures, The stone
which the builders rejected,⁷' &c. Yes, they had read and
read it again, and oftentinles reeited it in their Great Hallel ‚·
but you shall never persuade. them that these things were
spoken of their Messiah, but rather of Jacob, as somesg or of
David, as others& or of the congregation of Israel, as Aben
Ezra, &c.; but by no means of their Messiah: for they
dreamed of such a Messiah that should come so according to
their heart's desire, that it was ineredible any Jew should
ever reject or despise him.

Ver. 13¹1: Ἀγράμματοί εἶσι καὶ ἰδιῶται· Uillearned and {ono-
ναηί mem] ‘⁴ Illiterate and vulgar persons also.'' For it is
supposed in Jomax, that even the high priest himself may be
ἀγράμματος, unlearned, when yet he was by no means a vulgar
person, no ἰδιώτης, plebeiam. “ They say unto him, ‘ Lord high
priest, do thou read thyself out of thine own mouth: perhaps
thou hast sorgotten3 or perhaps thou didst never learn.'”
And so vice versa. Therey are some called ΠἾἾΤΔἾἻἽΠ ἰδιῶται,
who were not so mzlearned. There are three kings that have
no part in the world to come, viz. Jeroboam, Ahab, and
Manasseh; mter-527 rim-im (mad flur common persons,
Balaam, Doeg, Ahithopel, and Geliazi.”

But these apostles were unlecwned, and ἰδιῶται, men of no
deyree 01· qzcalily, but vulgar peyrsons, and of the common
people. So 1 Sam. xviii. 23, Γῖῗῖἳᾙ ω’] ³25³& a poor and
vile man. The Targumist reads, mrim wem '122 A poor
