most plainly hath respect in this place. Those words in
Moses regard a just marriage, but the apostle bends it to
carnal copulation with a harlot. Whence it is necessary to
take the words of Moses in this sense: ‘⁶ ‘Therei'ore shall a
man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his
wife: and they two (only) shall be one flesh :⁸ that is, they
between themselves only shall be carnally coupled‚ and not
with any other man or any other woman.’'

VER. 3 : Τὴν ὀφειλομένην εὔνοιαν· Due benevolence] thab
is wont to be understood here is known well enough. For
although the word εὔνοια includes all mutual offices of living
together, you see to what the apostle applies it, ver. 53 and
that not without reason, when the J ewish masters seriously
prescribed many ridiculous things of this matt-em sometimes
defining the appointed times of lying with the wife, sometimes
allowing the vow of abstinence. Modesty forbids to relate
their trifies3 I had rather the reader should go to them him-
self than defile our paper with them. Only these few things
we cannot but produce, that a reason may in some measure
appear why the apostle treats of this matter:

“ Lyingt with the wife, concerning which mention is made
in the law, is this : gentlemen, who neither exercise merchan-
dise, nor any other work, every day3 workmen, twice a week ς
scholars of the wise men, every sabbath-eve.'’

Ver. 5: Μὴ ἀποστερεῖτε ἀλλήλους, διο. qurcmcl με not one
the other, ege] “ Hell that by a vow constrains his wife from
his bed, according to the school of Shammai, let him do it for
two weeks3 according to the school of Hillel, for one only.’'
Rambam upon the place writes thus: “Let him keep this
his vow for one week only. But if he will keep it longer, let
him put her away and give her dowry. But they say, Let
the scholars go forth to learn the law, even without the per-
mission of their wives, for thirty days. These, indeed, are
the words of R. Eliezer. But according to the wise men, it is
lawsul for two or three years: and the tradition is according
to the wise men.'’
