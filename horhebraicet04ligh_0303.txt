of Reuben is read, but it is not interpreted. The deed of
Thamar is read, but it is not interpreted. The first history
of the golden calf is read and interpreted: the second is read,

which Aaron himself relates of the calf, is called the second
history of the calf. In it are these wor‚ds ΠῚΠ ‘vij N* Ἶ,
