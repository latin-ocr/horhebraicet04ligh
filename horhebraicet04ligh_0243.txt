times.

Διὰ τοὺς ἀγγέλους· Because of the anyels] Because cf the
anyels? XVhom? Vv'hether because of qood anyels ,9 or be-
cause of bad ,9 or because of the mim'sters ,9 The reader knows
what is said for this sense and for that and for the other,
which we will not repeat.

I. TrulyZ, if I would understand a veil by ἐξουσίαν, power,
by anyels I would understand devils, which are called angrels
in this very Epistle‚ chap. vi. 3. And if Ι were of opinion
that the apostle treated here of public assemblies only, I
would render his words to this sense: “A woman in the
public assembly of the chureh ought to have her face veiled,
because of the devils: namely, that they ensnare not men by
the appearance of the beauty of women's faces, and provoke
them to gaze upon their faces, and to behold them with lasci·
vious eyes, while they ought rather to look up to heaven, and
to be intent upon divine things.”

II. Or if by anyels are to be understood mfflistem, our
interpretation doth suit very well, which makes a veil a sign
of shame and reverence before God, not of subjection towards
the husband. For certainly this sounds more logically:
women are to be veiled in religious worship, as being ashamed
before God; therefore let them be veiled before those who
are the ministers of God: than that women are to be veiled
in religious worship, because they are subject to their hus-
bands3 therefore they are to be veiled before ministers.

ΙΙΙ. If we take anyels in the most proper sense, that is,
for 90οᾶ anqels, and attribute its most proper sense to the
expression, ἐξουσίαν ἔχειν, to leave power, that is, to have power
in one's own hand, then we might interpret the place after
this manner: A woman hath not the power of her own head
in her own hand, διὰ τὸν Θεὸν, in respect of Gari, but is to be
veiled in reverenee towards God: but she hath the power of
her head in her own hand, of not veiling herself διὰ τοὺς ἀγγέ-
λους, in respect qs the anyels ,· for she oweth not such a reli-
gious reverence to them.

IV. But I suppose the apostle looks another way 3 and,
