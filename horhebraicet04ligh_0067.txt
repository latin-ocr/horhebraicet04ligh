what account must they make of those Jews that knew no
other language butm the Greek? Surely they must be looked
upon as in the lower, yea the lowest degree of Jews, who were
such strangers to the language so peculiar to that nati0n‚
that is, the HebreW. Such are those whom we find men-
tioned in Hieros. Sotahn: “ R. Levi Ben Chajathah, going
down to Caesarea, heard them ΓΠΕΥἸΞἾί-ἵξκῗ {mm 3³³5? recitiwy
their phylacteries in Greek, and would have forbidden them:
which when R. J ose heard, he was very angry, and said, If a
man doth not know how to recite ΠἾἾἾΨΝ in the holy touque,
must he not- recite them at all? let him perform his duty in
what language he can.”

Caesarea Philippi is the scene of this story, a city that
the Rabbins make very frequent and honourable mention of
in both the Talmuds. This being one of the cities in Deca-
polis, which were all under the Gentile or Greek jurisdiction,
it seems there might be some Jews there that understood
Greek, but not Hebrew. Otherwise they would, doubtless,
have said over their phylacteries in the Hebrew, though they
could not do it in the holy tongue.

3. There were many Jews in several countries, and those
very probably to whom both the languages of Hebrew and
Greek were their mother—tongues. The Hebrew in their own
country, and the Greek among the Grecians; the Hebrew
in the families and synagogues of the Jews; the Greek
amongst their fellow-citizens the Gentiles. Such was Paul
of Tarsus, a Greek eity3 and yet was he a “ Hebrew of the
Hebrews‚'' Phil. iii. 5. And such those of Cyprus and Cy-
rene seem to be, who are mentioned ehap. xi. 19, 203 who
in Cyprus, Phoenice, and Antioeh itself‚ preached the word
of God amongst the Hebraizing Jews (though perhaps they
might also speak the Greek tongue), and at length to the
Hellem‘sts in Antioch, i. e. ‘ the Jews who understood nothing
but Greek,' to whom the Hebrew tongue was perfectly un-
known. For so I would distinguish the Hellenists from the
Jews in that place; and not oppose them to the Jews, as if
they were not Jews themselves. And let me orave the
reader's leave to give my judgment of these Hebrews and
Hellenists in these following particulare:
