Ch. xi. 21.] Exercitations upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 5245

Moses, but would promote and raise all unto a more splendid
form and pomp.·‘' That this was the error of the Corinthiam
about the Eucharist, these observations make evident which
the apostle hints, both in this verse and those that follow ε of
which in their order as we meet with them. And first, let us
weigh this that is under our hands:

l. It is clearer than the sun, that the apostle sharply re-
proves the Corinthians for these very suppers: Ι say, for the
very sappam, and not only for an abuse happening in the sup-
pers. For ἴδιον δεῖπνον, lais own supper, he calls that which
was to be eaten at home, if any were so hungry before the
Eucharist, that he could not abstain: he dishonoureth the
church with the supper which was brought into it. lVeigh
these things and think whether these Agyapce were those that
are supposed.

II. The Corinthians placed somewhat of religion in these
suppers when they brought them into the church. But what
was that? Thus doing they retained the shadow and memory
of keeping the Passover, and very willingly they imitated· the
example of Christ in the ante-supper, that they might the
more freely serve their J udaism in so doing : yea‚ they
dreamed that the Eucharist was instituted for the same com-
memoration with the Passover. It was epidemical among the
Jews converted to the gospeL that they embraced Christ-
ianity‚ but did not forego J udaism: yea, that they brought
over the things of the gospel as much as could be to the doc-
trines and practices of the Jews.

and ὃς δὲ μεθύει, another is drunkeoz, to the rich3 which we
also once believed: but they seen] rather to be applied to the
different nations. Drmzkem to the J eWS‚ celebrating the
Passover in their ante-suppers before the Eucharist3 and
hunyry, to the Gentiles, not being hungry so much out of
poverty or necessity& as that they would not embrace such
an ante-supper as savouring of Judaism.

We may interpret the word μεθύει, another is almvm, more
favourably than to extend it to extreme drunkenness. For
