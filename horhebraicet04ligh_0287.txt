Roman magistrate, and, among other things, this is demanded
of him3 ‘· Why did you not go to ῙἾἾΞΝ ‘¹2 be abidan, the
Temple? He answered, ‘I am an old man, and I was afraid
lest you should tread me under foot.' To whom the other
replied‚ ‘ XVas ever any old man trod under foot ζ’ A miraele
happened3 for that very day was an old man trodden upon.”
Where the Gloss‚ 37³2& Ἦ, “ Be Abiclan is a house or temple
where they eat and drink in honour of an idol, ‘75:2³3 {47:550ss

But elsewhereS it occurs in another sense: 37³3& *27 *1²:³0
’ἾᾸἾ “ T he books of the ‘ be abidan‚’ do they snatoh them out of

the fire, 01· do they not snatoh them? &27⁸5 ΓΝ Yes, and no .·’'
that is, sometimes they do, and sometimes they do not. But
what the books of the be abidan were, the Gloss teaeheth in

feared to go into beth abidan, lest in the dispute they might
rise up against them and kill them.”

And now let us return to our own business. What hinders
but that we may be of opinion that the house of Aquila at
Ephesus and Rome, and of Philemon at Colosse, might serve
for such a purpose? namely, sometimes for holy lectures, and
disputes either with Jews or among Christians. Not that the
publio assembly in the churoh should be neglected, but that
