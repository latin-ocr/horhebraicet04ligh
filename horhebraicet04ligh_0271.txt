were indeed persons among them who were not in truth
private men, but judges and magistrates, ancl learned men;
but as to that present action, ἀνεπλήρουυ τὸν τόπον (which
you must not understand of sitting in lower seats, but of
their present capacity), they supply the place, or sustam the
condition of private persons, as to the present action, as men
contradistinct from the public minister. Ἰδιώτης indeed oc-

Πῶς ἐρεῖ τὸ ἀμὴν, Sto. How shall he say, Amen, &c.] lt was
the part of one to pray, or give thanks,-of all to answer,
Amen. ‘⁶ Theyg answer Amen after an Israelite blessing,
not after a Cuthite,’' Sto. But “ theyh answered not 372&
Wfflfi* the orphan Amen 17²3me VJ& &Lm nor tlte snatehed
A men,'’ &c.

The orphan Amen was when Amen was said, and he that
spake weighed not, or knew not why or to what he so an-

psalma,- that is, a psalm to which neither the name of the
author is inscribed, nor tho occasion of the composure.
&ww among the Talmudists is sometimes a scol, or un-
learnedk. Let it be so, if you please, in this phrase. Such
is the Amen concerning which the apostle in this pla-ce3
when any one answers Amen foolishly to a thing not under-
stood.
