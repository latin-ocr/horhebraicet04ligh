‘ Abraham ς’ and the institution of circumcisio& ver. 4, ‘⁶ Be-
hold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of
many nations.” Why is his name called ‘ Abrahaml’ For
the sealing of his promise, ‘ Thou shalt be a father of many
nations.' And why was this circumcision appointed him? For
sealing the same promise, ‘ Thou shalt be a father of many

which he answereth in the verse following? The Jews were
wont thus to object concerning themselves, by reason of their
liberty obtained by the redemption out of Egypt3 so that
they would not endure by any means to be called ‘ not free,’
John viii.33. “ Rabbanl Jochanan Ben Zaccai said, The
blessed Lord saith, The ear which heard my voice upon mount
Sinai, at what time I said, For the children of Israel are my
servants, and not the servants of servants, but it goes and
