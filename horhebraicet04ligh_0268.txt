And in the Hallel, and in the Book of Esther, ten may read,
and ten interpret.’'

The Gloss is thus: ⁵⁸ ‘Let not one read in the law, and
two interpret.7 Much less let two read. And the reason is,
because two voices together are not heard. ⁴ But in the pro-
phets let one read, and two interpret‚' because the interpret-
ation was for the sake of women and the common people,
who understood not the holy languago. And it was necessary
they should hear the interpretation of the law, that they
might understand the precepts: but of the interpretation of
the prophets they were not so accurate.''

Ver. 3 ε ‘O δὲ προφητεύων· He that prophesieth] The word
προφητεύειν, to prophesy, comprehends three things, ‘ singing
psalms‚' ‘ doctrine,’ and ‘ revelation :³ as ver. 26.

I. To prophesy is taken for ‘ singing psalnis,' or eelebrating the
praises of God, 1 Sam. x. 5, “Thou shalt meet a company of pro-

understand in what sense a woman is said to prophesy, ehap.
xi.5; that is, to ‘ sing psalms.’ For what is there said by
the apostle, “ A man praying or proplaeesyin9‚⁷' and “ a woman
praying or prophesyiny‚” is explained in this chapter, when it
is said, “ I will pray,'' and ‘⁴ I will sing.'’

ΙΙ. To prophesy is to ‘preachss or to ‘ have a doctrine: as
ver. 26. Hence the Chaldee almost always renders &⁸22

a prophet, by ΝἾΞΕ) α scribe, or learned, or one that teacheth.
When it is very ordinarily said of those that were ondued
with extraordinary gifts, that “ they spake with tongues and
propliesied.”' Acts X. 46, it is said, that “they spake with
tongues, and magnified God.” For they prophesz'eass is said,
‘ they magnified God ε’ and that these two ways, either by
praising God, or by proaching and declaring the wonderful
things of God, Acts ii. 11.
