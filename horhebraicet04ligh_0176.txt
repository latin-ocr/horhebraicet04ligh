Romans, especially of such as were Libertinos [ficeclncen] Τ heym,
when they had beguu to remove the rubbish, and had withal (ligged
up graves, found very many works made of baked earth, and not a
few of brass 3 the workmanship of which they so admired, that there
was no sepulchre which they (ligged not up 3 and having got great
plenty of such things, they sold them at a great price, and filled
Rome ‘Necrocoriuthiis,' with tlte spoils of tlte Corinthiun deacl; for
so they called those works which were taken from the sepulchres,
especially such as were made of earth. And when Mummius laid
the city waste, there were pictures found of admirable workmanship
which were brought to Rome. For the arts of painting and coun-
terfeiting, and other arts of that kind, were very much improved in
Corinth and Sicyon.

Then situation of the city, now rebuilt, was of this nature. There
was a high mountain, whose perpendicular was three furlongs and a
half 3 the ascent thirty furlongs, and it ended in a sharp top. The
lnountain’s name was Acrocorinthus. At the very foot of Acroco—
rinthus stood the city. The compass of the city made full forty fur-
longs: it was strengthened with a wall, as much of it as the moun-
tain had laid bareO: Acrocorinthus also was walled as far as it could
be fortified with wallingP. “And as we went up (theyq are the words
of Strabo) the ruins of the old city appeared, so that the whole
coinpass was eighty-five furlongs.”

The mountain on the top of it had the temple of Venus, a temple
SO wealthy‚ ὥστε πλείους ἢ χιλίας ἱεροδούλους ἐκέκτητο ἑταίρας, [leat it
Ιιαιῖ more than a thousand whom-priests [famulas meretrices} whom
men and women had dedicated to the goddess. Inr the old city
heretofore stood the temple of J uno 3 where all the Corinthiam
women being gathered together, Periander the tyTant, by his
Officers, stripped them stark naked, without any diffcrcnoe3 and
having carried their clothes into a certain pit, he hurnt them to
Melissa his deceased wife 3 with whom he lay after she was dead.

The history of the first founding a gospcl-church in this city, Acts
xviii, makes it plain that there were very many Jews there, and one
synagogue of them at least, if not more.
