2. The second is, that word ματαιότητι, ver. 20, which indeed
16 1101 unfitly rendered vanitgs .· but then this vanily is impro-
perly applied to this vanishing‚ changeable, dying state of the
creatione. For ματαιότης, mmmm, doth not so much denote
the vanishing condition of the outwarcl state, as it doth the
inward vaoziz‘gs and emptiness of the mind. So the apost-le,
speaking of the Gentiles, (concerning whom he speaks 11616,)
tells 116, ἐματαιώθησαν ἐν τοῖς διαλογισμοῖς αὐτῶν· They became
min in their ‹inzaqinatior2sd. And again, ἔθνη περιπατεῖ ἐν
ματαιότητι τοῦ vobs* αὐτῶν· ΤῘιθ Gentiles wall& in the ‘061me of
ΐῖιαίν mindss. So also, “The Lord knoweth the thoughts of
the wise, ὅτι εἰσὶ μάταιοι, that they are vainfss' To all which
let me add this observation further, that throughout this
whole place the apostle 6661116111 10 allude to the 1616611166Ἴ
bondage in Egypt, and their deliverance 0111 of it, with a
comparison made betwixt the ,16111611 and the Gentile church.
&Vhen Gocl would deliver Israel from his bondage, he chal-
lengeth him for his son and his firstborn‚ Exod. iv. 22. And
in likc manner 1116 people of the Gentiles do earnestly expect
and wait for such a kind of manifestation of the sons of God
within and among themselves. The Romans, 10 whom this
apostle writes, knew well enough how many and how great
preclictions and promises it had pleased God to publish by his
prophets, concerning gathering together and adopting 60116 10
himself among the Gentiles : the manifestation and productioni
of which sons, the whole Gentile world 110111 now wait for, as
it were, with an outstretched neck.

Ver. 20: Τῇ γὰρ ματαιότητι ἡ κτίσις ὑπετάγη, &a For tlte
creature was made subject to vanitys] The Gentile world were
subject to vanity of mind3 but how? οὐχ ἑκοῦσα, ἀλλὰ διὰ τὸν
ὑποτάξαντα, not willinyly, but by reason of him who ῘιατΙι sub-
jected tlte same. May we not say, ἐματαιώθη ἑκοῦσα, it became
vain zoillz7n9ly, but ὑπετάγη ματαιότητι οὐχ ἑκοῦσα, it was made
subject to vanity not wz'llz'nyly? For let 116 166111 10 1116 very
first original of Gentilism, that 16, 10 1116 first confusion of
languages‚ by reason of the attempt 10 build the tower at
Babel. I confess there are some passages in the Gloss of the
Targumists upon this matter, (Gen. xi.) that might move
