It is well known that the J ewish writers do take Elias for
‘⁶ the angel of the covenantj’ Mal. iii. 1 3 and how osten have
we Elias appearing in the shape of this or of that man!
“ Eliasy came ἾΠῬΓῺ ‘'n-1: 717³? *mm and seemed unio them
as one oj'tlaemselves2.” “ ΠἫΠ ’Ἴ snm: &³2:1³7 ἻΓῑἾζῖΝ &Ny
ΠΞἾἾ 011 a certain day Elias came to R. J udah the Holy in
the slmpe of R. Chaicch Rabbala, 810. : having touched his teeth
he took away their pain. The next day R. Chaiah Rubbah
came to him and said, ‘ How doth Rabbi, how do his teeth 3⁶
To whom he replied, ⁴ From the time that thou touchedst
my teeth with thy fingere they were healed ³.''

Ver. 20: Διὰ τὸ τρέφεσθαι αὐτῶν τὴν χώραν ἀπὸ τῆς βασιλι-
κῆς· Because their country was ozomislzed bys the kfzfny's country]
Here we may call to mind that of Ezek. xxvii. 17: ‘⁴ J udah
and the land of Israel [O Tyre] were thy merchants; they
traded in thy market wheat of Minnith and Pannag, and
honey, and oil‚ and balni.'' So the Latin, the Interlinear,
our English, and the Italian versions. But others make
Minnith and Pannag not places but merehandise ware ;
name-ly, the Syriae, Arabio, Greek, and the Chaldee espe-
cially, who hath rendered the words so that R. Solomon and
R. Kimohi confess they know not well what he means. As
for ῘῑΙὶηηίΐΙι, we have it. mentioned in Judges xi. 33: for
whichb the Syriae hath DIczkir, for a reason not known 3 and
the Greek Arnon, for no reason at all. As for Pammy, we
meet with it nowhere else. Whatever it be, the words of
the prophet hint to us the same thing that the evangelist
doth here3 which is strengthened also from that in 1 Kings
v. 11 ε “ And Solonion gave Hiram twenty thousand measures
of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of
pure oil ; thus gave Solonion to Hiram year by year.”
