but a Sanhedrim nowhere. There was a very famous cathe-
dral church at Alexandria, wherein were seventy pompous
stalls ; but it was but a church, not a Sanhedrimi.

ΙΙ. In what veneration the Jerusalem Sanhedrim was held
everywhere amongst all sorts of Jews may be collected from
this: that the rule and determination concerning intercalating
the year, concerning the beginning of the year, and the ap-
pointed time of the feasts, &a came from it3 as also that was
esteemed. the keeper and repository of the oral law.

ΙΙΙ. The judgment of life and death, in the matter of
heresy and heterodoxy, belonged only to the Jerusalem San-
hedrim: and it is some such thing that is now before us.
The Christians were to be sent from the synagogues bound
to Jerusalem, that is they would not deny their saith they
might be condemned to die. The synagogues by their three
menk might scourge them, but they could not pass sentence
of death: and these goodly men conceived there was no
other way to extirpate Christianity but by the death of
Christians.

only exhortatory, which St. Paul desired, the fathers of the
Sanhedrim knew the synagogues were heated with so great
an indignation against Christianity, that they would most rea-
dily undertake what was desired. WVhere by the way we may
make this observa-tion, That the power of life and death was
not yet taken out of the hands of the Sanhedrim. I have
elsewhere given you a copy of a letter from the Sanhedrim to
those of Babylon, and also to those of Alexandria ¹.
