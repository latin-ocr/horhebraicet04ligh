that these words. ‘⁸ The Lord said unto my L01·d‚’· are the
words of Eleazar, whose lord of right Abraham might be
called.

“ R. Zachariahk, in the name of R. Ismael, saith: God
had a purpose to have drawn the priesthood from Sem, ac-
cording as it is said„ ⁸ He was the priest of the Most High
Grod.q But when he pronounced his blessing of Abraham,
before his blessing of God, God derived the priesthood from
Abraham. For it is said, ‘ And he blessed him, saying‚
Blessed be Abraham of the Most High God, possessor of
heaven and earth: and blessed be the Most High God.’
Abraham saith unto him, ‘ Doth any one put the blessing of
the servant before the blessing of his lord ξ’ Immediately
the priesthood was given to Abraha1n3 as it is said, ⁶ The
Lord said unto my L0rd‚ Sit thou on my right hand.’ It is
written afterward, ‘Thou art a priest for ever,' *nan-1 ³737

his blessings in due order] ‘⁶ And forasmuch as it is writ-
ten, ‘And he was a priest of the Most High God ;' it inti-
mates to us that he was a priest, but his seed was not.'’ Can
we think that this gloss was framed at that time, when St.
Peter so confidently‚ as though none would oppose him in it,
applied this passage to the Messiah? which also our Saviour
himself did before him to the great doctors of that nation,
and there was not one that opened his mouth against it ¹.

Ver. 38: Βαπτισθήτω ἕκαστος ὑμῶυ ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ
Χριστοῦ· Be baptized every one of you in {lae name of Jesus
Cla-isa] Beza tells us that “this doth not declare the form
of baptism, but the scope and end of it. Yet this clause is
wanting in the Syriae interpretcr.'' W hel-ever he might
have got a copy whercin this was wanting, yet is it not so in
other copies. But to let that pass: what¹ ho sayeth, that
“ this (loth not (leclare the form of baptism? is, I sear, a
mistake: for at that time thoy baptizcd amongst the Jews
in the name of ‘Jews' (although among thc Gentiles they
baptized ‘ in tho namo of t-hc Father. and the Son, and Holy
Ghost’), that Jesus might be acknowledged sor tho Messiah
by them that wore baptized: than which nothing was more.
