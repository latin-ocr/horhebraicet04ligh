book to that place, The Lord hear tlcee ἱη tlte clay of
trouble, &c. Psalni xx, he takes refuge in a common axiom
of their-s, “He that prayeth and is not heard must fast also)²
As if that maxim was founded upon the equality of numbers,
and the authors of that maxim did so design it: q. d. He
that pours out eighteen prayers, according to the number of
those eighteen psalms, and is not heard, let him fast, and he
shall be heard, according to the tenor of the psalm immedi—
ately tollmving, Tlae Lorcl hear tlwe in {lm (lay of trouble,
i. e. in the day when thou troublest and afflictest thyself with
fasting.

II. l will not make any nice inquii-y for what reason they
should exclude the second psalm out of the number. We find
in it, however shut out of the number, a considerable testi-
mony to the resurrection of the Messiah : and perhaps to this
the apostle may have some respect in these words. But if
not, by this his noting the number and order of the psalm we
may guess he spake to this sense, viz, Y e have a testimony of
the resurrection of Christ in the very entrance of the Book of
Psalms, so near the beginning of it, that we meet with it even
in the second psalm.

Rabbins do interpret this psalm of the Messiah; but he had
rather it should be applied to David. For the Jews take
special care that the Messias should not be acknowledged as
the genuine Son of God. Hence¹¹¹ szclras Tillimn, “ Tltou
art my Son : hence we may answer the heretics‚ who say ‘ He
is Son to God? Do thou answer, am& *¹:¹⁸2* ΠΠΝ ‘'L‘' ’ρ

He dotlz not say, ‘ Thou art Son to me,’ ΠΠΝ '⁴21 &378 but,
‘ Thou art my Son.y [A very learned distinction indeed !] As
the master speaking kindly to his servant may say to him,
‘ l love thee like my own son.”'' So the Ta1·gumist⁰; ‘¹ The
Lord said m& ἦ ΝΞΝἰ) ἾἎΞ ΞἮΠ ‘ Thou art beloved to

They do indeed acknowledgc that the Mcssiali is conccrned
in this l'salml‘3 but then is you will bc a true Jew indeed,
