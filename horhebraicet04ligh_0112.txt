according to his judgment‚ ΓΠἾἿΌ clf-ew away the people to
an irreligious worship3 and (leals with J ames as he intended
to do with the rest. So he falls, and his goods are confis-
cated3 and so that begins to be accomplished which our
Saviour had formerly told the sons of Zebedee, “ Ye shall
drink of my cup,'' &a “ The Rabbins say, killing [by the
sword] is a heavier punishment- than strangli11g³.”

Ver. 7: Αἱ ἁλύσεις ἐκ τῶν χειρῶν· His cka'insfrom laets hands]
Ι am mistaken if the Jerusalem Talmudists do not express
ἁλύσεις τῶν χειρῶν by ΝῬἿΠὩ ἾἾἚ, ‘ chiromam'coe,’ hancl-
manacles. “ It is written, ‘ The Lord spake to Mamxsseh,
and to his people, but they hearkened not3 wherefore the
Lord brought upon them the captains of that host of the

king of Assyria, which took Manasseh ΞἺἺΠᾉ. that sig-

Targum on 2 Chron. xxiii thus renders it mmm D' ‘mrim

is ill writ instead of ἾἾὊξ but Ι stand corrected very wil-
lingly if Ι guess amiss. ’

[n those words of our Saviour, “ Bind the unprofitable
servant hand and foot‚'' &c. it is plain to see how he alluded
to manacles and fetters.

is, an mayel in his shape: for it was familiarly received amongst
them that the a22fyels did sometimes put on the shape of this
or of that person. ⁵‘ It is written, ‘ He hath delivered me
