Oh. x. 17.] Exercitations upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 227

Passover called, over which thanks were given after meat;
and in which our Saviour instituted the cup of the eucharist ;
of which we have spoken largely at Matt. xxvi. 27. When
therefore the apostle marks out the cup of the Lord’s supper
with the same name as the Jews did their cup, he hath re-
course to the first institution of it, and implies that giving of
thanks was continued over it by Ohristians‚ although now
under another notion.

Thus his reasoning proceeds: ‘⁴ As we in the eating of
bread‚ and drinking of the eucharistical cup, pal-take of thc
body and blood of Christ; so in eating things offered to idols,
men partake of and with an idol. You pai-take of the
blood of Christ, therefore fly from idolatry. I speak to wise
men ; do you judge of the argument„ For the very partici-
pation of the eucharist seals you up against idolatry, and
things offered to idols.''

Ver. 1 7 : Οἱ γὰρ πάντες ἐκ τοῦ ἑνὸς ἄρτου μετέχομεν· For we all
are partakers osthat one bread] The manner of reasoning, “ We
all are one body, because we partake of one bread,'' recalls that
to mind which among the Jews was called ΞἾῪΨ mizius), or
κοινωνία, communion. The manner and sense of which leam
out of Maimonides⁰; “ By the words of the scribes (saith he)
it is forbid neighbours to go [on the sabbath day] ΓΠΨἻΞ
ἿἿΠἾΠ in a place ceppropriated to one, where there is a division
into divers habitations‚ unless all the neighbours on the sab-
bath eve ἹΞἾῺἿ enter into communion. Therefore Solonion
[for they make him the author of this tradition and custom]
appointed, that each place be appropriated to one man, there
where there is a division into divers habstations, and each of
the inhabitants receive there a place proper to himself ; and
some place also is left there common to all, so that all have
an equal right in it, as a court belonging to many houses,
which is reckoned a place by right common to all. And
every place which each hath proper to himself is reckoned
vnn-1 mma a proper place. And it is forbid that a man
carry any thing from a place proper to himself into the place
common to all, [that is, on the sabbath3] but let every one
use the place appropriate to himself alone, 1³75: ἹΞἾὩἾΖ] Ἷζ-ἰ
