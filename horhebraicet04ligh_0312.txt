306 A delenda to 1 Cor. xiv. [Oh. ix.

But I do not remember that Ι have found one clause alleged
out of the version of the Seventy in the whole Tuhnud, either
one or other.

Let it also be added, thatf ‘the book of Ben Syra’ is a
prohibited book3 and yet you may find it cited in both Tal-
muds: in that of Jerusalem, in the tract Barac-atlas ,· where
it seems to be the book of Syracides: but otherwise in divers
other plaoesh. But Ι do not, I say, remember that Ι have
found the version of the Seventy alleged in any place ; and Ι
scarce think that such an allegationi could pass me unob-
served. W hich thing more increascth my suspicion that
those Jews owned not such a version, and that they under-
stood the transcription of the Seventy not to be the version
of, but the copying out, the very Hebrew text itself. And as
to the version itself, whereof wc are speaking, how they stood
affected towards it, one may in some measure learn from this,
that when another version is alleged by them they cite not
this at all.

ΙΙΙ. The Jews knew well enough that the Greek version
was not published for Jews, but for heathen3 and was done
by their labour who came unwillingly to that work, nor would
have suffered any such thing, if it had laid in their power to
have hindered it. But now, with what faithfulness such a
thing was done, the thing itself speaks, and the Jews knew it
well enough; who knew also well enough with what small af-
fection the whole J ewish nation stood towards the heathen.

By no argument, therefore, shall any persuade me that
that version was a pure and accurate version, exactly accord-
ing to the Hebrew truth which the interpreters had in their
hands; and that the differences which we now pcrceive in our
Bibles were risen thence, that the Jews depraved the He-
brew text according to their plcasure. For I shall never
believe that any masters of the Jews would exhibit a pure,
uncorrupted, and exact Bible to the heathen, in tho Greek
version; and obtrudo an interpolatcd‚ depraved, corrupt one
upon themselves. And let us call themselves in for judges
in this case :—
