you must have a care how you acknowledge him the begottenq
Son of God. It would be a vain and impertinent thing to
collect all their little artifices by which they endeavour to
evade the force of this place. It were much more proper for
us to observe the way of the apostle's arguing, and by what
means he makes it out that these words of the Psalmist point
at the resurrection of the Messiah. Take this passage by
the wayr: “ R. Houna saith, ῙἻἻἾΞἾΠ ’1βὲΠέ :³³pr 'a
There are three portioris (fclaastisements divided. The fathers
of the world and all generations received one part3 the gene-
ration of persecution another3 and the generation of the
Messias another. And when his time cometh, then will the
Holy Blessed say, ΠΨἻΠ riwin *mr-252³? Ἶί’73] It lies upon
me to make him α new creature. And so ·he saith, Εῆῆζτ

Whe'n the Jews ask a sign of our Saviour, he constantly
gives them the sign of Jonas the prophet3 that is, that his
resurrection, which should come to pass, should be a most
undoubted proof for him that he is the Son of God, the true
Messias. So Rom. i. 4, ‘⁶ He was declared to be the Son of
God by his resurrection from the dead :'' for so was he indeed
distinguished from all mortals and sons of men. And God
saith he had then begotten him, when he had given a token
that he was not a mere man by his divine power whereby he
had raised him from the dead. And according to the tenor
of the whole psalm, God is said to have begotten him then
when he was ordained king in Sion, and all nations subdued
under him. Upon which words that passage of our Saviour,
uttered immediately after he had arisen from the dead, is a
good commentary: ‘⁶ All power is given nnto me,'' &c. Matt.
xxviii. 18.

What do those words mean, Matt. xxvi. 29, “I will not
drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when
I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdon13'' They
seem to look this way, viZ. “ 1 will drink no more of it before
my resurrection.'' For in truth his resurrection was the
beginning of his kingdom, when he had overcome those ene-
mies of his, Satan, hell, and death: from that time was he
