Judah‚ nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh
come ;' but then this does not argue that Shiloh must (lei-ive
his original from the tribe of Judah3 only that some domi-
nion should continue in J udah till Shiloh should appear.”
VVhere, by the way, it is worth our observing, that- the Sama-
ritan text, and interpreter in that place, instead of ΠζῬῖΠ
reads ‚7³7sz without the jod, and instead of ’11ἶῖᾈῖ ἶᾛῷ
from between his ‘feezss' that text reads '¹³³³727 ΓΞὈ from be-
tween lais ‘banners;' and the interpreter hath it ἾἻἿἽΟ ΓΣΠΞ
from between lais ‘ rmzks} or companvies.

That figment concerning Messiah Ben J oseph‚ or Messiah
Ben Ephraim, (for he goes by both those names,) whether it
was first invented by the Jews or by the Samaritans, is not
easily determined. The Jewish writers make very frequent
mention of him: but the thing 115611δ makes so much for the
Samaritans, that one might believe it was first hatehed
amongst themselves3 only that the story tells us that Mes-
siah was at length slain3 which the Samaritans would hardly
ever have invented concerning him. And the Jews perhaps
might be the authors of it, that so they might the better
evade those passages that speak of the death of the true
Messiah.

II. However, it was impiety enough in Simon, if he gave
out himself for a prophet, when he knew so well what himself
was; and if you expound his “giving out himself to be some
great one,’' no higher than this, yet does it argue arrogance
enough in the knave. I would not depress the sens-e of those
words ooneerning John Baptist, Luke i. 15, ἔσται μέγας ἐυώ-
πιου τοῦ Κυρίου, lae shall be yreat in tlte 32¹5th of the Lord ‚· but
if we take it in the highest degree, “ he shall be a prophet
before the Lord Christ‚” it carries both an excellent truth
along with it, and also a most plain agreeableness with the
office of John. And when Stephen expresseth Moses to have
been a prophet in these termsva δυνατὸς ἐν λόγοις καὶ ἐν
ἔργοις, He was miffty in words and deecls, perhaps it bear's the
same sense with what the Samaritans said and eonceited con-
eerning this Simon, that he was ὴ δύναμις τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡ μεγάλη,
the yreat power οβ’ God.
