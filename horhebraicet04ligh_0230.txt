‘224 Hebraeo and Talmuclical [Oh. x, 8.

Ver. 8: Εἰκοσιτρεῖς χιλιάδες· Three-and-twenry thousand]
But in Numb. xxv. it is, “ Four-and-twenty thousand.’' And
in the Talmuds3 “Thoseg four-and-twenty thousand that
perished by reason of Baal-Pcor‚” &c. And “ Balaam ¹¹ came
to receive his reward for the four-and-twenty thousand that
had perished.” thence therefore is it in Paul, “ Three-and-
twenty thousand’' only?

To omit that which is not unusual in the Holy Scriptures,
when the same story is recited in two placeS, to bring in
somewhat different in the reckoning, either of the things or
the men or the years 3 and that not without the highest rea-
son3 as, compare 2 Kings viii. 26 with 2 Ohron. xxii. 23 and
2 Kings xxiv. 8 with 2 Chron. xxxvi. 93 and very many of that
nature3 let us see what the Talmudists say of this story.

They discourse of it in divers places of the tract Sanhe-
‹ir-imi to this sense. Upon those words of God to Moses,
0270 “ζί>’δ2Ἶτ“ζῬτ3“ΓἹΝ ΠΡ, “ Take all the heads of che poeple, and
hang them up before the sun‚” they thus comment: “Take
all the princes of the people, and make them judges; that
they may slay all those that transgressed with Baal-Peor. If
the people sinned, what did the heads of the people sin?
Saith Rabh Judah, Rabh saith, God said to Moses, ‘Divide
to them judgment-seats.' Wherefore3 Because they judge
not two in one day.’' Now, J ew, find fault with Paul if you
list; and he hath wherewithal to answer you, even from your
own writers:

I. I-Ie saith not that tlm'ee-aml-ttmzty thousand were all that
fell in the case of Baal-Peor; but he saith that three-and-
twenty thousand fell in one day.

II. It is manifest enough that God made use of a double
vengeance against the sinners, namely, by judgcs, and by a
pestilence.

111. Butk now their own count-rymen say, “It is not law-
ful for one bench to judge two in one ‹lay.” Or bc it granted
(which is granted also by their countrynicn) that it is lawful
to judge and slay too, so it be by thc same kind of death, how
