so he instructs Christians, that they be not (leceived by the
crafty and magical spirits of the Jews3 and in like manner he
stops the mouth os the Jews, that they should not deny the
Holy Spirit to be bestowed upon the Gentile Christians.

Ver. 8: Λόγος σοφίας, ἕω. The word of wisdom, effic] W'hen
the apostle, in this very chapter, numbers up thrice the gifts
of the spirit, perhaps it will not be in vain to make them
stand parallel in that very order wherein he recites and ranke
them :—

We will not be so curious as to conclude that all the words
that are placed in parallel denote the same things, when Paul
himself inverts his own order concerning the ‘ gifts of heal-
ings‚⁵ and of ‘miracles,’ 01² ‘powers,’ ver. 9, 28, 30: yet we
cannot be so negligent but to observe a· little his order, that-
we might fetch something out of it :

Λόγον σοφίας, the word of wisdom, therefore, we attribute to
the apostles‚ because they unfolded, in a divine clearness‚ the
whole mystery of the most deep wisdom of God concerning
Christ, and the salvat-ion of man. Concerning which our apo-
stle very frequently.
