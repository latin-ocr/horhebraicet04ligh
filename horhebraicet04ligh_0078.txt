wickcd man, nor an idolator, but converted3 and therefore
Moses makes him chief in that removal out of &baldea that
his conversion might be known, although the command con-
cerning the departure from that country came first to Abra-
ham. And if it was not lawful for Abraham to have forsaken
his father, being yet an- idolater, much less was it so when he
was now become a worshipper of the true God.

II. It is indeed said, that “ 'l'erah lived seventy years,
and begat Abraham, Nahor, and Haran :⁹⁷ but as it is against
reason to suppose they were all begot in one year, so there
is no necessity to think they were begot in the order they
are placed in in the story. Here that common maxim in the
Rabbins takes plac03 ΝἻΡῸΞ ’ii-imm :riom ΓΝ T here is
no first ancl last in clm hely ›S'crt'2)tm·e, i. e. the order of the
story does not necessarily determine the time of it. And
the Gemarists themselves, however they suppose that Abra-
ham might be older than Nahor one year, and Nahor than
Haran one year; yet do they at length conclude, &2³77
ΠἾΠΝἾ ΝὩἾΤ ΞΠἾΞΝ perhaps Abraham was {lm younyest oflrz's

in numbering the sons os Noah, where Sem is first in the
catalogue, though he was younger than Japhet.

lt is commonly received amongst the Jews that Sarah,
Abraham's wife, was the daughter of his brother H aran ; and
that not without reason. ΠἺΨ n ΠΞΟἾ [scala (say they) is

of ancient tradition; Ἀράνης μὲν, καταλιπὼν υἱὸν Λῶτον, καὶ
Σάρραν καὶ Μελχὰν Θυγατέρας, ἐν Χαλδαίοις ἀπέθανεν· Haran,
leaving] one son, Lot, and Sao-ak aad Melcha, two (ἰαῑιῃΙιίενδ,
died in Okaldeax. If therefore Sarah, who was but ten years
younger than Abraham, was lIaran's daughter, which seems
to be in some measure confirmed, Gren. xx. 12, we can by no
means suppose Abraham to have been the firstborn amongst
the sons of Tcrah, but llaran rather; unless we will trifle
with some of the Rabbins, and say that Ilaran begat Melcha
when he was but six or eight years old. But they conclude
at length a little moro rationally, ifl understand what they
