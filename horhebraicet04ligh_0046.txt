levelling the place he might have room enough to make this
court: whatever it was, l ‹leny not but the whole court might
go under that na1ne3 although, as Ι have elsewhere shown.
the very Solomon's porc-lc, strictly taken as a porcla, was only
the eastern part and poreh os that· court. And let me only
repeat what Ι have quoted in that placef: ἾὨΨἹ ῙΠΞΠ ἾΞΠΖ]
ΒἺἿΞῘί) ἹΞἾΠ Νἶῖ ΠἺῖῬἺΠ “ ΤΙισ priest's flate, ancl the grate
liedda& were ποῖ to be destroyed cet all, till God should renew
the1n.” Which inereaseth our *suspicion that the name
rffilffw Hzalclalc is derived from 7:3“17 Helecl, which signifies
time and aye, from the lastingness they had faneied of this
gate3 and that the word “ῼραία in this place might have some
such signification, as one would say, clm ‘aute qf time. And
perhaps the little priest's gate was the other gate of H ccldcdc,
from the same duration they eonceited in that gabe also3 for
there were two gates ofg that name on the south side of the
court, as we have noted before.

Ver. 19: ’Όπως ἂν ἔλθωσι καιροὶ ἀναψύξεως· lVlhell llw
times of rqfreslciny shall come. Ι may perhaps betray luy igno-
ranee in the Greek tongue, if 1 should confess that I cannot
see by what authority of that language the most learned
interpreters have rendered ὅπως ἂν ἔλθωσιν, Sco„ that when
the times of refreslcitzsf shall come; as the Vulgar‚ Erasmus,
and the Interlinear: or when they shall come‚· also the Eng—
lish, F rench, and ltaliauh: or afler- they shall come, as Beza.
I am not ashamed to confess Ι do not understand by what,
reason they thus render it, when it, so well agrees with the
idiom of that language to translate it, that the times of re-
freslciny may come. Psalm ix. ¹4> ὅπως ἂν ἐξαγγείλω· H ebrew,
