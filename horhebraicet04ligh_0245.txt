Ch. xi. 14] Exercitations upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 2:59

before he see her 0.'' But it was very frequently done, that
after one had seen a woman, he betrothed her to himself by
his anyels or deputie3‚ either out of his own modesty, or some
necessity compelling him.

VII. Hence the apostle seems to make mention of those
amyels, rather than of the men that deputed them to that
business; and that the more strongly to confirm and prove
the thing which he treats of. As if he should say, “ The
woman hath not only power of her head to bare her face
before him who is to be her husband, but before them who
are sent and deputed by him to betroth her: and from this
very thing (saith he) it is clear that the woman was created
sor the man : seeing she, that she might be for the man, hath
such a power of uncovering her face before those (ληρεῖς who
come to espouse her, when otherwise by the custom of the
nation it were not lawful.'' The apostle conceals the word
ΒἾἪΤἹῙ) εψοῑιεαῖε; and saith only, because of tlte anyels, not
because of the anyels of espousals ε for by the very scope of his
discourse that is easily understood, when in the words imme-
diately going before he saith, “ The woman is created for the
man.’' So also the Talmudists very frequently use the single
WOI'd Ε’ΠἾῖῬἾΠ anyds, when once it is known that they are
speaking of espousaIS.

Ver. 14d: Ἀνὴρ ἐὰν κομᾷ, &a Thac vs α mom have {0729
hair, ‹Sflc.] Whether the apostle reproves men’s long hair by
occasion offered from his discourse of women's long hair;
or (which is not improbable) that these Judaizing Corinth—
ians as yet retained Nazariteship‚ and for that cause let
their hair grow; that which he saith, that “nature itself
teacheth that it is a disgrace for a man to have long hair‚''
is sufficiently confirmed from hence, that it is womanish.
There were indeed divers nations which wore long hair, as
καρηκομόωυτες Ἀχαιοὶ, tke Zony-baired Aclzoeans in Homer3
‘ Gallia Comata: Gaul whose inhabitants wore Zonq bair, in the
historians‚ &c.; but whether in this they followed the light
of nature, or rather did it out of their barbarous breeding‚ or
that they might appear more terrible to their enemies, is
upon good reason inquired.

You will say then, Whence comes it to pass that the Na-
