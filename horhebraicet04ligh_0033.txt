IV. The dignity and prerogative of the apostles above the
rest of the disciples did not so much consist in this gift of
tongues being appropriated to themselves3 but in 11115, amongst
other things, that they were capable of conferring this gift
upon others, which the rest could not do. Philip the deacon
doubtless did himself speak with tongues3 but he could not
confer this gift to the Samaritans, that they also should speak
with tongues as he did: this was reserved to Peter and to
John the apostles.

moved upon the face of the waters? have an eye to those
waters that covered the earth3 whereas Moses plainly distin-
guisheth between the abyss, that is, the waters that covered
