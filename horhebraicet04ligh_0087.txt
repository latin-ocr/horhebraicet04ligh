Moses was endowed with a spirit of propheey even in Pha-
raoh’s court, (to which that passage may refer, that “ he was

mighty in words and in ‹leeds,”) and knew himself designed
to redeem Israel out of Egypt; and so he thought that
people eoneeived of him too. For they could not but know
the story of his miraculous preservation in his infaney3 his
providential eduoation in a prince's eourt3 and especially
the apparent signs of a prophetie spirit in him. Which
though Moses himself speaks nothing of, yet doth Stephen
relate it, not without good authority and the consent of his
countrymen: who all suppose Moses miraculously born, and
as wonderfully saved in the ark of bulrushes3 namely, that
he was conceived when his mother was a hundred and thirty
years of age, brought forth without any of the pangs of child-

birth, and born &Tr :um qood, that iS‚ rosum& ζὊΠ aptjbr

concerning Pharaoh's putting his crown upon the head of the
child Moses, and his throwing it to the ground, is told also
by the J ewish Rabbinsd, only with this variation; that
Moses himself took the erown from Pharaoh's head and put
it upon his own.

in this matter by a passage taken out of Olzwayiyalaf .· “ There
