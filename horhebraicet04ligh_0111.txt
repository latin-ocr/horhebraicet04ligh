gift of tongues and prophecyss Will not this degrade our
apostle even below the ordinary ministers who received these

that is an apostle take his commission from the hands of one
that is not so himself ’Ξ It was not ordinary for an apostle to
be baptized by one that was not an apostle ; and it would be
strange if such a one should add over and above greater
things to an apostle.
