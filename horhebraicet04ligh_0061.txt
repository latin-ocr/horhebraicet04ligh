marmarinf] of the Greoz‘ans ayainst {lae Hebraeos] First, let us
consider who these Hebrews were.

ι. Τ116 word ”5237 a Hebrew, admitted another kind of sig-
nification under the second temple than it had before and
under the first: because, in the Old Testament it had refer-
ence to the original and language of that nation3 in the New
Testament, to their travels and their language. Abraham is
first called ”5227 Gen. xiv. 13, α Hebrew. So Symmachus, the
Vulgar, and others : but the Greek interpreters render it
περάτης, passer-overu [transitor]. But this version need not
concern us much; when it is plain the interpreters have ren-
dered the word '¹5:327 according to the common use under the
second temple, and'not according to the primitive and original
use of it. For the same reason the Rabbins incline the same
way.

‘⁴ R. N ehemiahX saith, ‘ Abraham is called ἾἾᾏΞῖ α Hebron),

because he was of the posterity of Heber [Ἲὶᾆῖ]; but the

Rabbins say, ‘he is so called because he came from beyond
[ἾΞὩ] the river.'” And they add withal (which deserves

some inquiry) h’5237 ἶἾῖζᾶῖἶἮ rrum mmm Amly for that he
used the Zanyaaye beyond {lm river. I would rather have said,
he might fitly be called “729 a labrem, because, even in
Mesopotamia and Chaldea, he retained the Hebrew language
in the proper sense. For, if he brought over the transfluviali
or Ohaldean language into Canaam as his own and family’s
mother-tongue, it is hardly imaginable by what means the
Hebrew tongue, strictly so called, should become the native
and proper language of his posterity. I have elsewhere offered
another reason why he should be termed a Hebrew in that
place in Genesis3 which Ι still adhere to.

ΙΙ. AfterZ the Babylonish captivity‚ there was such an
alteration of things, that ”5237 mvl? the [febrem tonyzoe be-
came the lanquaye beyond the river, or the Clzaldee touque. This
is plain from those several words, Bethesda, Golyotlwo, Akeldama,
