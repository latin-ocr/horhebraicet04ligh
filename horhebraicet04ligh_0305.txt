Oh. vii.] A (blenda to 1 Cor. xiv. 299

under a heap of stonesq.. Which example also a certain Rab-

bin afterward urgeth to his great grandson GamalieL that he
also should bury under ground the Book of Job Taryumized‚
which he had in his hand, to be oonsumed.

The Book· of Job Tmywmized was that book translated into
the Chaldee language, the mother-tongue os the nation‚ the
tongue into which the Law and the Prophets were rendered
in the synagogues3 and yet by no means did they tolerate
the version of that book, (which, indeed, was not read in the
synagogues,) though rendered in that language; much less
would they tolerate the version of the Law and the Prophets
into a more remote and more heathen language.

These things well considered, one may with good reason
suspect that the Jews thought not so honourably of any vor-
sion, as to cast away the Hebrew Bible‚ and to espouse that
in the roon] of it. And what they might or did think con-
cerning the Greek version of the LXX, as it is called, let us,
as much as we can, briefly search.

THE story as it is in Josephus and Aristeas hat-h no need
to be repeated, being so well known to all. From which how
vastly different is it from the story as it is related in the
Tahnudists! which we transcribe verbatim from Masseclaetk
