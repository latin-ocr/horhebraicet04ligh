economy, to which times the apostle refers in this place, is not
easily determined.

As to the clause that follows immediately in the apostle,
‘⁶ commanding to abstain from meats which God hath created
to be received,’' ὤας that passagek comes into my mind,
“ When the temple was destroyed the second time, the Pha-
risees ” [i. e. the separalists] “ were greatly multiplied in
Israel, who taught· that it was not lawful to eat flesh nor to
drink wine. R.Josl1ua applied himself to them and said,
‘ My sons, why do you not eat flesh, nor drink any wine'Z’
They say unto him, ⁶ Shall we eat flesh, that were went to
offer it upon the altar, and that altar is now broken down?
shall we drink wine, that were wont to pour it out upon the
altar, which altar is now gone? ‘ If it be so,' saith he, ‘ then
we should not eat bread, because the offerings of bread-corn
are ceased3 we should not eat any fruits, because the offering
of first-fruits is at an end3 we should not drink water, because
the drink-offering is ceased,' '' &a And a little asten “ Since
the kingdom of iniquity’' [the Roman empire] “hath decreed
sharp things against us—it is but just that we should ordain

amongst ourselves ww& &10¹5 &Bw not to marry wives, nor
beget children, &c.; and so it would come to pass that the
seed of Abraham would deeay and fail of itself. But let Israel
rather be zum) mis-taken than ΓἺἿΌ preszcmptuous.”

Howl great a difference is there between these men and
the Nicolaitans ἔ And yet these as foolishly and super-
stitiously erred in one extreme, as those did impiously and
filthily in the other. As to the Nicolaitans‚ we may wonder
at their ignorance, if they knew nothing of this deeree of the
apostles3 and their impudence in so bold a contradiction, if
they did.
