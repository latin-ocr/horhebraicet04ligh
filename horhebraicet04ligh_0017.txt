ried away by the king of Assyria3 that they indeed shall not
partake of the blessings of the Messias, though their posterity
should. So that there may lie hid something of ambiguity iu
the word Israel in this passage we are now examining; that
is, whether, in the conception of those that speak it, the teu
tribes arc included, yea or no. For commonly the name
Israel amongst the Jews was wont to be taken for the Jews
only; so that they called themselves Israel, and the ten
tribes, by way of distinction, tlze ten tribes. In which sense,
and according to which distinction, that of the 01103131οΟ seems.-
to be said, “ Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they lsrael-
ites? so am I.-·'

ΙΙ. What opinion was to be had of the two Messiuhs, Mes-
siah Ben David, aud Messiah Ben «Ioseph, or ssen Ephraim,
as he is called by the paraphrast, Cant. iv. 53 whether they
were to reign at the same time, the one over the ten tribes,
the other over the two? or whether in succession to one
another, both of them over the whole nation? Messiah lien
Joseph was to be cut offe. And then what must become of
his subjects, whether they were of the ten tribes, or of the two,
or of all?

Ill. lt is further obscure in their writings, whether they
had an apprehension that the Messiah should reign alone3 or
whether he should substitute any king or kings under him, or
after him. It seems probable to them that the Messiah
should reign his thousand years alone: but then as to that
age which they called &2³¹9 “7'15‘537 (if eternity be not meant by
it), what did they conceive must be done in it? Whether
kings should be substituted in it of the race of David ’Ξ They
can dream of nothing but mere earthly things: and if from
such kind of dreams we might conjecture what kind of future
stat-e that &2³¹7 ἾἺΠὩ should be, we may guess what should
then be done. But to what purpose is it to trace error, where,
as we cannot so much as fix a foot, so the further we proceed
the more we slip?

What kind of kin-adom the apostles had framed iu their
imaginations is not easy to conceive. There was something
that might seem to cherish that opinion about a temporal
reign, wherewith they had been leavened from their very
