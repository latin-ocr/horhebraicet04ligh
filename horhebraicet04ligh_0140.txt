blood gathered about the beart in the time of slaying‚ and the
blood found about the liver⁷ they are not guilty of cutting off:
but whoever eateth of any of that blood, let him be scourged z
because it is said, Thou shalt eat no blood. But concerning
being guilty to cutting off it is said, Because the lise of the
flesh is in the blood, A man therefore is not guilty of cut-
ting off, unless he eats of that blood with which the life
goes out.’‘'

IV. Ι know what the κρεάὸια πνικτὰ, strcmyled flesh, in
Athenaeusx means; but that hath no place here, nor is there
any reason why such meats as he there sets on the table
should be forbidden even to the J ew. Nor would Ι by πνικτὸν,
straozylecl, understand ἾΠΠ ‘372 ἿΞΝ the member of a living]
beast, partly because I suppose that included in the word
αἵματος, blood ‚· and partly because it is thus determined by
the Rabbinsy concerning it: “ They learn by tradition, that
that which is said in the law, ‘ Thou shalt not eat the life with
the fiesh,' forbids the eating of a member torn from a living
animal : and concerning 1ΤΠἻ [Ὀ ἾΞΝ me member cut off from
α living) baasi, (1οἀ saith to Noah, ‘But flesh with the life,
which is the blood thereos, shalt thou not eat.'” So that to
eat a member so cut off is to eat blood: and under that
clause καὶ τοῦ αἵματος, cmd from blood, is contained the prohi-
bition of eating both ἾΠΠ {D ΞἺ tlce blood of α ἷίι··ἰη9 beast,
and also ’rh-l *4⁷2 ἾΞΝ the member qf a liz-5229 beust. And
under that clause καὶ τοῦ πνικτοῦ, ancl ⁰f tlcz'nqs stranyled, is
the prohibition of eating flesh of a beast not well killed, so as
the blood issueth not out as it ought to do. Concerning
which there is a large discourse in the tract Cleolin. obscure
and tedicus enough3 however, l cannot but note one passagez
out of it: “ If any one desire to eat of a beast before the lise
of it be gone, let him cut off a piece of fiesh from the killing
place to the quantity of an olive, and salt it very well, and
wash it very well, aud stay till the life of the beust bc gone
out of him, and then 110 may eat it: this isequally lawful
