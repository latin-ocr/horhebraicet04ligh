tions. But in those things concerning which there was no
such appointment oi· punishment, what was to be done ἐ There
were faults worthy of punishment, but neither law nor· scribes

but certainly provision ought to be made, that such things be
not (lone without punishment. Hence excmnmnm'eation was
invented as the general punishment of such faults. The thing
itself, if Ι mistake not, speaks this, if we well weigh those
things for which excommzmicatz‘on was inflicted.

II. The causes or reasons of excommum'ccztion were generally
two: namely, N3172⁷237f0r money3 and ξὲΠἾἻᾷἺ-*Νζῗ for epicu-
rism, This distinction we meet with in a place inf their
Τ almud‚ where they treat at large of exeonzmzmz‘cation, and
