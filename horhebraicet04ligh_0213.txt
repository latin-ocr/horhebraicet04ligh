Ch. vii. 6.] Exercitations upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 5207

You have examples of some that far exceeded these bounds,
in the Gemara at the place alleged3 which see.

Rambam concludes (concerning the common people)‚
“ Know thou that it is in the power of the wife to retain her
husband from going to sea, or into the army, unless it be
near at hand3 lest she might be defrauded of her (lue bed.
She may also restrain him from passing from 0110 work to
another, lest her bed be thereby diminished3 1110 study of the
law only excepted.”

Ver. 6 : Οὐ κατ’ ἐπιταγήν· Not by oommmzdmmzt.] Συγγνώμη,
permission, and ἐπιταγὴ, command, do something answer to
those words, very usual among the Fathers of the Traditions,
,ΠἿΨἾ and rimi-1. But now they would have marriage en-
joined under a very severe command.

“ TheX man it commanded concerning begetting and mul-
tiplying, but not the woman. And when doth the man come
under this command? From the age of sixteen or seventeen
years. But if he exceeds twenty years without marrying, be-
hold he violates and renders an affirmativey precept vain.
But if he be studious in 1110 law, and conversant in it, and is
he fears marriage, lest the care of providing for his wife hinder
his study in the law, he may still tarry3 because he that is
employed in the precepts is free from that precept: much
more he that converseth in the study of the law. He whose
mind is always taken up in the study of the law, as ssen Azzai,
and he that is intent upon it all his days, if he marrieth not
a wife, in his hand is no iniquity. But if affection prevail
upon him, let him marry a wife, although he have no children,
lest 110 fall into evil thoughts.'⁷ “ LetZ 001 a man refrain
himself from generation and multiplying, unless he hath chil-
dren all‘eady.” The Gemara upon this place thus, “If he
have children, let him refrain himself from generation and
multiplying ; bnt from marrying a wife 101 him not refrain
himself. It 18 forbid him to be without a wife, because it 18
said, It 18 not good for man 10 be alone.’' And “ Whoso-
evera gives not himself 10 generation and multiplying is all
one with a murderer. He is as though he diminished from
the image of God,'’ 810.
