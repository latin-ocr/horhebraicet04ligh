7'0 Hebraeo and Talmudical [Ch. vii. 3-

μάσας, &tm ‘Wlngfbre the Chaldeans (md other Asesopotamians
moviny tnmults ayainst him, he tkcaztgllctfit to remove his seat. 23³0.
W here we see the Chaldemzs, amongst others, are called those
of ‚Mesopotamicm nor indeed without cause, when, as Era-
tosthenes in Strabo tells usp, that ‘³fllesoyiotamicc⁹ with the
country of Babylon, is contained in that great compass from
Euphrates and Tigris.⁷'

And so perhaps the Rabbin newly quoted distinguisheth:
that that flIesopotamia, which he makes to be called by God
³³7¹& mys Mesopotamia, is Charran; where the worship of God
had been kept up in the family of Nahor, and which had been
the native countr)⁷ and breeder up of eleven patriarchs. And
so let ΠἾΠὙἾΞΠ her consorts be Babylon and Chaldea ; for in
what other signification ΠἾΠἸἻΞΠ here can be taken, I
cannot well tell.

In that Stephen speaks of God appearing to Abraham
while he was yet in chaldea. before he removed to Charran,
when Moses rather ascribes that passage to Terah his father,
Gen. xi, he speaks with the Vulgar, according to the com-
monly received opinion of his countrymen;· who not only
taught that Abraham acknowledged and worshipped the
true God, even while his father Terah worshipped idols; but,
further, that Terah was so zealous an idolater, that he de-
livered his son Abraham to Ninirod, te be cast into a fiery
furnace. We have the tale in Bereslzc‘tlc Rabbaq, ridiculous
enough. [Fregerat Abrahamus idola Temohi, et dixit, ea
mutuis ictibus se confregisse, litigantia de farinae eis oblatae
comestione. Suspicans Terachus se illusum ΠἾἻΞὮἹ ΠἿΞΕ]
ἾἹἾὮΞΒ prehendit Abrahamum, et tradidit eum Nimrodo: qui
projecit eum in fornacem ignis. Ast Abrahamus exiit e for-
nace salvus* etc]

not confound this passage with that in Gen. xii. 1 ; for Ste-
phen, and indeed the thing itself‚ assures us that· this was
spoken to Abraham in Chaldea, but that in Oharran. Hero
