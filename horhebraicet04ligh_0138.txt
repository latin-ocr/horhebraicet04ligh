woman, or more, for propagation’s sake: and this it is that
God brands with the reproachful name of forn‘z'ccztiorm ‘⁴ they
commit fornicatz'on, but do not inultiply.” Whatever else is
understood by this word, Ι would certainly understand this3
namely, that the apostles prescribed against polygamy‚ a thing
esteemed indifferent amongst the Jews (as fornication was
amongst the Gentiles), and therefore not unfitly mentioned
here amongst things indifferent.

Tell me in what place in the New Testament bigamy or
polyganiy is forbidden, if not in this. Perhaps you will say,
in that of our Saviour, Matt. xix. 4, 53 where indeed pro-
vision is made against putting away of a man's wife, but
hardly against polygamy, especially comparing the apostle's
words, 1 Cor. vi. 16. Provision is made that bishops and
deacons shall not have two wives, 1 Tim. iii. 2: and Ι should
not believe but that the same provision is made against the
bigamy of the laity. But where is that done if not in this
place?

IV. There was another fornication ordinarily so reckoned
also in the opinion of the Jews themselves (for they did not
account the having many wives tobe form'cation)‚· and that
waS, besides what they call simple fornication, their marrying
within ‘she prohibited degrees, that which they commonly
called ΓἾἿἾΏ ηαῆῑειίηεεε. These marriages they were so
averse to, that to some of them they allotted ‘ death‚' to all
of them ,rx-5:³¹> or cuttinq off: concerning which Maimonides
speaks largelym. In the mean time they allowed the Gentile
that became a proselyte to the Jewish religion to marry
with his kindred, though never so near in blood, with his
sister if he pleased‚ or with his motherss, dvc. Hence per-
haps arose that incestuous marriage mentioned ῐ Cor. v. 1.
They did well, therefore, to provide by this apostolical decree
against such kind of marriages as these, being so odious to
the J ews
