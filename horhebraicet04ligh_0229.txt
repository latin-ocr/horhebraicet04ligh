CHAP. Χ.ἀ

Vm. 2: Καὶ πάντες εἰς τὸν Μωσῆν ἐβαπτίζοντο· And were
all baptized anto Moses] They had been newly circumcised
before their going out of Egypt. For when God accuseth
them by the prophet, that they eomplied with the oustoms of
the Egyptians, and worshipped their idols, Ezek. xx. 7-‚ 8, it
is more than probable that they neglected circumcision‚ as
also other of God's appointments, and yielded themselves
conformable to the Egyptians in all their irreligious rites.
Wheme, by a peculiar precept, God provided, when he insti-
tuted the Passover‚ that, before the eating of it, every one
should be circumcised, Exod. xii. 48 ε which that it was done
also is clear out of J osh. v. 5, ‘⁸ All going out of Egypt were
circumcised.''

To eiroumoision is added baptism in the cloud andin the
sea; and the latter seal took not away the first, but super-
indueed a new obligation. They were not circumcised into
Moses, but they were baptized into Moses. The Jews them-
selves confess that they were baptized at mount Sinai from
those words, Exod. xix. 10. But the apostle fetcheth the thing
higher, that he may show that the types of the gospel-saora-
ments were both divine and also miraeulous.

tual Book tlzat followed them] Not that the very roolf in Horeb
followed thom, but that streams of water, flowing from that
rock, followed thom, and were gathered together into pools
wheresoever they encamped. Hence that rhetorical figure
very usual in the prophets, “I will give in the wilderness
pools of water,'' when diseourse is of the watering of the
Gentiles by the gospel and the spirit. “ Duringe all the
forty years they had a well.'' And the Targum of J onathan
oonoerning another wellf3 “ From the time that the well in
Mattanah was given them, it was made again to them brooks
that were overflowing and violent; and again it went up unto
the tops of the mountains, and went down with them into the
valleyS,'’ &o
