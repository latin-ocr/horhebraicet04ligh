2352 Hebraeo and T celmudical [Ch. xi. 5.

[Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles‚] are the breakings
out of the year, by the reason of the association of men and
women, and because of transgressions. Because in the days
of thosle'easts men and women assembled together to hear
sermons, and cast their eyes upon one another. And some

say that sor this cause they were wont to fast after Passover
and Pentecostss'

From whence it may readily be gathered that men and
women should not so promiscuously and confusedly meet and
sit together, nor that they should so look upon one another
as in the courts of the Temple, and at Jerusalem, when such
innumerable multitudes flocked to the feasts: but that women
should sit by themselves, divided from the men, where they
might hear and see what is done in the synagogue, yet they
themselves remain out of sight. Which custom Baronius
proves at large, and not amiss, that those first churches of the
Christians retained.

When the women therefore (lid thus meet apart, it is no
wonder if they took off the veils from their faces, when they
were now out of the sight of men, and the cause of their veil-

something else within. For,

religious meetingS, but belongs to those things which were
done by men and women in their houses and inner chambers;
for there also they used these rites when they prayed and
handlcd holy things privately, as well as in the public assem-
blies. “Rabban¹ Gamaliel journcying, and being asked by
one that met him concerning a certain vow, he lightcd off his
horse ηωὩΠΞἾ and veiled himself, and sat down and loosed
the VOW.” So R. J udah Bar Allai, on the sabbath eve, when
he composed himself in his house to meet and receive the
sabbath, “ they brought him warm water, and he washed his
face and hands and feet, ΓῚΒὍ ww: ἾΖΩΞἾἾΠἾ (md reding]
