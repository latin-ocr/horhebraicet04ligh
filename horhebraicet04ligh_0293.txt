And these passages they have of Syria. ‘⁶ Ing three re-
spects Syria was like to the land of Israel. It was bound
to tithes, and the seventh year; you might go thither in
purity: and he that bought a farm in Syria was as though he
bought one in the suburbs of Jerusalem.” And again ¹¹,
“ Syria as to some judgments is as the land of Is1‘ael.” And
againi, “ They bring out [the fruits of the seventh year] into
Syria, but not without the land.'’ Note, that Syria was not
reputed ⁶ without the land,' but in divers things to be united
with Palestine. And many passages of that nature may be
produced both of Syria and of Babylon.

Now then when our discourse is of the Hellenists, the Jews
of these countries and of this language are to be distinguished

is, whose mother-tongue was Greek„ among the Jews, whose
mother-tongue was Syriae.

THE people that returned from Babylon are numbered,
Ezra ii: and the sum total is computed to be “forty-two
thousand three hundred and threescore‚” ver. 64. And yet
the number of the families there particularly reckoned,
amounts not to more than thirty thousand. So that those
twelve thousand which are comprised within the sum total,
and yet are not numbered by their families, were either ple-
