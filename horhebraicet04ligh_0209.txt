They who were to judge in that affair were called ῦῗφτ

The same Fathers of the Traditions speak many things of
the plaintiff and defendant choosing themselves judges or
umpires to decide their differences3 and that both parties be
bound to submit themselves to their sentence, although it be
a form of judging not altogether according to the form of the
statute. For example’s sake, three judges were required to
determine concerning pecuniary suits, and they by canon and
statute, such as were made elders or presbyters by lawful
ordination. But the contending parties might, if they would,
choose themselves only one such arbitrator or judge3 or three
private men, and not elders. ‘⁶ Thel Rabbins deliver; pecu-

Of this matter both Talmuds treat largely enough in the
tract Sanhedrim Π.

Out of the Babylonian take these passages in the place now
alleged : “ Rabh Nachman judged‚ and erred in his judgment.
