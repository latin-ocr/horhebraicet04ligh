Alexandrian MS. it is.

It is hardly worth our inquiry whether through careless-
ness or set design they have gone thus wide from the words
of the prophet 3 for indeed nothing is more common with
those interpreters than to depart after that manner from the
Hebrew text. One may suspect that they did it on purpose

the τὸ λεῖμμα τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, 2126 remmam of Israel, mentioned
Rom. xi. 5. And by naming Edem, one of the bitterest
enemies that Israel had, from whom a remnant should be
taken out and reserved, the thing propounded is the more
clearly made out3 viZ. 212622 God had visited 2126 Gentiles,
&a The words also in the Greek version, which St. Luke
follows, do prove the thing too; mention being made of “ all
