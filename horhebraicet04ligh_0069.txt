I would say, to those of palestine: for to them it is that
the name of Hebrew doth of greatest right belong3 which
these two particulars (if I mistake not) will make very plaino.

1. That it seems most proper that they should be termed Α

Hebrews who use the Hebrew tongue and none else as their
natural language, rather than they who use the Greek and
Hebrew tongue indifferently. 2. Indeed the Mesopotamiam
used the Hebrew only as their mother-tongue‚ and ought in
reason to be accounted amongst the Hebraeos in general;
but they went commonly under the denomination of 173¹)ss
the captz'vitqs‚ because they dwelt still in the place whither
they had been led captive, and had not returned into their
own land. But those of Palestine who had returned thither
were the most properly called Hebrews, because they had passed
over from beyond the river, and had brought the traufflzwian
tongue along with them.

And as to what concerns this present matter, viz, the mur-
muring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews about an equal
distribution of the common charity‚ it may be made a question,
whether any other besides those of Palestine had as yet sold
their lands and patrimonies. For omitting that, by reason
of the distance of place, they could hardly yet be capable of
doing it; that concerning Barnabas's selling his land in
Cyprus seems to hint some such thing, and that it was a
thing very extraordinary‚ and that had not been done else-
where. But our inquiry is chiefly about the Hellenists, not the
Hebrews: and what we have said concerning both is ingenu-
ously submitted to the candour of the judicious reader.

whom the charge and care of the poor was intrusted) was
translated from the Jewish to the Christian church. For
there belonged to every synagogae D‘UDD ’λ three deacous,
with whom that care was depositedsl.

II. As to the number seven, I would not be carious. The
multitude of the poor and the increase of the church made it
necessary that the number of the deacons should exceed the
number that were allotted for every single synagogue3 why
