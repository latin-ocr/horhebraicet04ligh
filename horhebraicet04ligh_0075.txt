light through a window, come and give nie light before niy
face? So did the holy blessed God say to Abraham, ‘ Because
thou hast given light to me, ΠἾΠἾἾΞΠὩἾ ³37& &mmmm-⁹2
οιιί of my ZlIesopotamia, and its compatzz‘ons, come and give
light to me in the land of lsrael.''' VVhether or no it be
worth the while to inquire why God should term it mys Meso-
potamia, as also what should be the meaning of ἴἺἾΓιἻἾΞΠ
laer consorts or compaozion85 yet can I not but take notice that
this adjunct doth once and again occur in the writings of the
Jewsss “ Ο seedn of Abraham my friend, Ι took thee sronl
the ends of the earth 3 nmmum wemmam), viz. [νυνι
illesopotamia aad laer conzpanions. VVhoU is he among you
that fearet-li the Lord? This is Abraham: who walketh in
darkness: who came ΠἿἾἿἾΞΠΌἾ NVJ-&53:022 out of Meso-
potamia and ker consorts, and knew not whither3 like the inan
that dwelleth in darkness.'' lt is written indeed N‘WQEDND,
as if it should be out of Spain; but I correct it by the au-
thority of the Aruch; and, indeed, the very sense itself cor-
rects it. The Gloss hath nothing but this trifling passage in
it; “ Ι have found the interpretation of illesopotamia, viz. that
it is the name of a city in Aram Naharaiin.'’

The geographers clo indeed distinguish between 111630-
potamia and. Babylon, 01· Ghaldea3 so in l'toleniy’s fourth
table of Asia, to omit other authors, ‘H Βαβυλωνία περιορί-
ζεται, ἀπὸ μὲν ἄρκτων Μεσοποταμίᾳ, &0.: “ The country of Ba-
bylon is bounded on the south by Mesopotamia‚” &c And
yet Babylon may in some measure be said to be in filosopo-
tamia ‚· partly because it lay between the two rivers Euphrates
and Tigris, but especially according to the propriety of Scrip-
ture language, because it was “ beyond the river.'' Which
we may take notice was observed by the Vulgar interpreter
in Josh. xxiv. 3, where what in the Hebrew is, “I took your
father Abraham Ἶζῐξῦ *¹ng fwm the other side of theflood,''
he hath rendered it, “ I took your father Abraham dc Meso-
potamioe finibus, from the bowlers of Mesopotamia.''

Josephus, speaking of Abraham and his removing from
his country, hath this passage Ρ, Δι’ ἅπερ Χαλδαίων τε καὶ τῶν
ἄλλων Μεσοποταμιτῶν στασιασάντων πρὸς αὐτὸν, μετοικεῖν δοκι-
