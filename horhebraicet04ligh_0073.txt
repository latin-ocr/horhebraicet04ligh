from the crown of the hcad3 they thrcw many to the beasts,
and forced several of them to fight one with another: so that
they destroyed at least two hundred thousand men.'' lt must
surely be an infinite number of Jews that could commit so
great a slaughter (the like the Jews did in Egypt and Cyprus).
It might be a wonder how so vast a multitude of Jews could
be got together'in those eountries: but this is not our present
inquiry.

Thatg which is rather to be discussed is, what language the
Cyrenian Jews used. I would say Greek 3 for that was the
language of Cyrene, the city having been built by the Gre-
cians‚ and the whole country under the government of the
Ptolemies, as Strabo tells us in the place before quoted. Ι
would reckon them, therefore, among the Hellenists, to whom
the Hebrew tongue was strange and foreign3 unless that this
synagogue, having been conversant at Jerusalem, might per-
haps have learned the language there.

There is a dispute in the place newly quoted, whether it be
lawful to alienate a synagogae from its sacred to a common
use: and it is distinguished betwixt ἾἾΓῬ ³712* ΠΟΞΞΠ rh:
the synayoyue qs one maoz, and ΞῈἾ ³712? ΠΞΠΞΠ ΠἿΞ a public

alienated, but the latter not, there is this story, which Ι have
newly quoted objected to the contrary 3 and this passage
further added, ζων ‘vm rvi-ns πων :ina-1:025& The
