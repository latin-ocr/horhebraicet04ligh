would enrol themselves under some peculiar apostle‚ it is no
wonder, Ι say, if they had regard to Peter, who first brought
in the gospel among the Gentiles, rather than any other who
brought in the gospel into this or that peculial· place. So
that opinion of the primacy of Peter seems to have arisen
among· the Jewish Christians, for their particular difference
of his ministry among the circumcision3 and among the Gen-

tile Ohrisffians, for his bringing in of the gospel among the χ

Gentiles.

Ἐγὼ δὲ Χριστοῦ· Ami I of Christ] If there were any
among the Corinthians who had been baptized by the baptism
of John only, as there were among the Ephesians, Acts xix. 4,
no wonder if they said, Ἐγὼ τοῦ Χριστοῦ, I am qf tlie Blessius,
not knowing as yet Jesus of Nazareth to be him. But be it
granted that all were better taught by Paul or Apollos, when
yet very many still inclined to J udaism, one may suspect that
they said, I am of Christ, or fllessias, in that sense as we for-
merlyh were instructed of the M essias; namely, that every one
should be enrolled and subjected under him only as our (lap-
tain, not under any deputed by him, or supplying his place.

Ver. 14: Κρίσπον· Crispus] The name Crispus is also in
use among the Talmudists. “ R. Aibulari saith, ἾΞΒἾἻΡ ἾἾἎ]
Nigri· Crispi.’' ἾΞΟἾἻρ ’Ἶ nn& R. Orfispusk saith.

Γάϊουὶ· Gaius] If that Gaius or Caius, to which the
Third Epistle of John is writ, were the Corinthian Gaius,
which is very probable, comparing Rom. xvi. 23 with the
seventh verse of that Epistle3 then John seems to have written
his First Epistle to the Corinthians. “I write (saith he) to
the church :'' to what church? Certainly to some particular
church, and where Gaius himself resided. But what Epistle
is that which he writ? Who would not more fitly say, that it
was the first of his Epistles‚ than that that which he writ was
lost? And if these things are true, you may look for Diotre-
phes in the church of Corinth, the ringleader in the schism.
But these things under correction.

Ver. 17 : Οὐ γὰρ ἀπέστειλέ με Χριστὸς βαπτίζειν For Christ
sent me not to baptiza] Paul was not appointed a baptist among
the Gentiles, as John was a baptist among the J ews3 nor
