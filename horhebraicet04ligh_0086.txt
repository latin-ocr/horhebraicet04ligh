however, that he did buy it (though not under that notion of a
burying-place) seems probable, because this was the first place
in which he pitched his tent and built an altar: all which he
would hardly have done upon another man‘s ground. It is
said of Jacob, that he bought a parcel of ground where he
had spread his tent, Gen. xxxiii. ¹9· And why should we not
think that Abraham did the same? only it is not expressly
said so of him, as it is of Jacob.

It might be no improper question here, upon what condi-
tions Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob sed their cattle and main-
tained their families 111 the land of Canaan? XVhether the
places and fields they occupied were common, and had no
proper owner? WVhether Abraham, not far from Sychem, in
the plain of Moreh, in the disposal of himself and his flocks‚
intruded upon another⁵s possession, or whether it was all
champaign, without any iord Ξ lt is probable it was neither one
nor the other: and therefore some third thing must be found
out, viz. that either they might purchase those lands, or take
them of the owners upon an agreed rent. lt is said cf
Abraham, that ‘⁸ 119 planted a grove in Beersheba‚” Gen. xxi.
33. How came he to any right in that piece of land? Had
that place no lord, no prince, no owner, till he came? If it
had any lord or owner (which is most probable), then it is
easy apprehending how Abraham might come by the posses-
sion of it, viz. by some sum of money, though there is no
mention made of it.

However, whether Abraham bought the plain of Mor-elz. οι·
not, it is very evident, from the words of the protomartyr, that
the patriarchs were buried in that place, where 119 111 his very
first entry upon that land had made his abedo, where he had
received the first promise of the land by vision, aud where he
erected his first altar. And I cannot believe but that either
St. Stephen or St. Luke would, in this their short way of
speaking, revive the memory of some such thing; viz. that
the patriarchs were buried in that· very same place where
Abraham had made his first abode, where he had received the
first promise of the land; yet that they did not possess that
land any otherwise than in their graves.
