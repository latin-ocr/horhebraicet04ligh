phetic teachers, because there was not any who by the study
of the Scriptures was become fit for that office. But why
then is it not rather said διδάσκαλοι προφητικοὶ, prophetie
teat-hers, than προφῆται καὶ διδάσκαλοι, prophets ancl tecm-hers ,9
Namely, because there were prophete who were not ordinary
teaolcers, but acted in their prophetic office occasionally only :
and they were such as rather foretold things to come than
ordinarily preached, or taught catechistically. But these
were both prophets and constant preachers too.

nahem is writ in the Alexandrian copy, at 2 Kings xv. [14]
Μαναὴν, Manaen: but the Roman hath Μαναὴμ, Manaem.
This our Manaen's edueation with Herod the tetrarch brings
to mind what is related in ιῙῑιοίιαδὶη h : ‘⁶ Hillel and Shammai

prophecies. He foretold Herod, when he was yet very young,
that he should come to reign: and when he did reign, he sent
for him, who foretold him also that he should reign above
thirty years. And he did reign seven-and-thil·ty.” J osephus
(who is quoted also by this our author) speaks much the same
as to part of the story ε “ There was amongst the Essenes one
named Menaem; who, besides that he was famous for the
holiness of his life, had obtained of God a foreknowledge of
future things. He called Herod, while he was yet a child,
king of the Jewsi,'’ &c

Ι do not think this our Manaen was the same person; nor
do I say that he was his son3 for had the Essenes children?
But whereas this person was so accepted in the court of
Herod the Great, and our Manaen brought up with Herod
his son, I cannot but suspect there might be something of
kindred betwixt them. But that matter is not tanti: it is
only worthy our considering, whether this Manaen might not
lay the foundations of his Christianity while he was in Herod
the tetrarch’s court, where John the Baptist preaehed, and
