Amos iv. 3: “ And ye shall go out> at the breaches one

them into the palacef'· there the' Targum and Syriae,
“ They shall carry them beyond the lnountains of Armenia :'’
and the Greek, εἰς τὸ ὅρος τὸ Ῥομμὰιν, melo the mount Bomman.

Aaron to make them gods that should go before them, ‘⁶ Hur
resisted them, and said to them, ΝΨἾΝῪΕ ἾΓἘῙνΥε skort-
