Now it may be asked, What, I pray, were those two copies
in which it was written ΓἼΞἾὨὩ, and ἾἾΏΞ, and nuum ἻΓῙΝΖ
They were Hebrew copiest, without? all controversy: and so
was that without all doubt in which it was written *slyffi and
*mirem and :QUI-'l-

There is no reason, therefore, why that tradition of the
thirteen places changed should bear so ill a repert, and be
accounted for a fiction, because those thirteen alterations are
not niet with in the Greek version : for the Talmudists plainly
treat of the chenty-two, not translating out of HebreW, but
transcribing the Hebrew books themselves.

Let us also add the introduction that the Jerusalem writers
make to this historyq : “ The Jerusalem Talmudists (say
they) wrote mmm pau-1 unm ἶπες r-xw‘vmw ³:³³7sz
Jerusalem, Jeruslclema, Tzapleow„ Tzeplcoua, Temen, Tamna :''
that is, they changed the writing of these Hebrew words:
and immediately they add, ’255537 minari ὈἾΖ] 'Ul-'Y Τ
ἾῖἳῸΠ The wise men altered thirteen places for Ptolemy the kin-q.
Which is also to be understood of the Hebrew words them-
selves : otherwise this does not suit with what goes before.

Tuus it remains doubtful whether the Talmudists acknow-
ledge any version of the Seventy-two elders or no. Let it be
granted, therefore, that they attributed θεοπυευστίαν, divine
iuspiration, to them from hence, that being put asunder, yet
they all conspired in one mind and sense 3 nevertheless, it will
not at all follow thence that any honour was given by them to
this version. which is carried about under that name.

One may much more readily perceive in it the breath of.
Jewish traditions than any inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
And although their own traditions were of account certainly
