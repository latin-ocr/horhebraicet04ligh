Oh. vi. 16.] Exercitatiows upon 1 Ιῄὶυῖεΐ. Corinth. 205

nothing was more ancient among those very wickecl 111611 than
mutually to exhort one another to eat things offered to idols,
saying to each other⁷ and to others also, as we may guess,

„5553 Let us eat, how very fitly might they be called hence
Nicolaitcms by the orthodox! '502 ‘75:³3 ΓἾὩΝ εαμὶηιᾳῐ), Let
us eatfleslc.

II. Wheneesoever the name of the sect comes, one can
scarce say whether the sect itself were more to be abominated
or more to be wondered at. For when the synod of Jeru-
salem had very lately decreed against eating things offered to
idols and fornication, (Acts xv‚) it 18 a matter of astonishment
that presently a sort of men should spring up, and they such
as professed the gospel, who should oppose them with all bold-
ness, and excite others with all industry and endeavour to eat
things offered to idols, and to commit fornication.

ΙΙΙ. Besides that those naughty wretches used and abused
the pretence of Christian liberty in the doing of these most
wicked actions, they invented arguments fitted to conceal
their wickedness and to defend their boldness3 which the
apostle reflects on in order.

The first is that πάντα μοι ἔξεστιν· all thim-as are lawfzcl for
me. Which although Paul might ver)v well say concerning
himself, “All things are lawful for mest as he (10111, chap.
x. 23 3 yet he seems secretly to whisper their very words and
argumentation: to which he also answereth, “But all things
are not expedient: but I will not be brought under the power
of any.''

The second is, “ Τ116 belly is appointed for lneats.” Things
offered to idols are meats3 erg0‚ he answereth, “ God shall
destroy both itq and them.’' Therefore care is especially to
be taken of the 80111, not of 111086 things which shall perish.
And be it granted that the belly is for lneats, but yet “the
body is not for fornication, but for 1116 Lord.'’

Ver. 16r : ’Έσουται γὰρ, φησὶν, οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν· For two,
saith he, shall be one flesla] “AndS they two shall be one
flesh3 *ins “wa 1:³3³]sz ΞἾΡὈ nanzelgs, in that place where

would take it to be at first sight3 and to which the apostle
