while he was fiying in the air, and so Simon Magus breathes
his last. If it had been taken notice of, that (if Philostratus
may be believed) it is probable St. Peter and Apollonius
Tyanaeus were at one and the same time together in Babylon,
doubtless there would have been some such tale as this framed
about St. Peter’s triumphing over him also.

That in Justin MartyrX concerning a statue erected at
Rome to Simon Mag11S‚ with this inscription, Simoni sancto
Deo, ‘ To Simon the holy God,' is shewn by learned men to
have been so called by mistake, when it was rather a statue
erected Semoni Sanco Deo. I sear there is some such mistake
concerning St. Peter's chair erected in Rome as there was
concerning the statue of Simon erected at RomeY.

Ver. 26: Εἰς Γάζαν, αὕτη ἐστὶν ἕρημος· To Gaza, which is
desert] tho is it speaks this clause, which is desert, the
angel or the historiam? Strabo indeed tells 1151Ζ that “Gaza
anciently was a noble city, destroyed by Alexander, καὶ
μένουσα ἕρημος, ancl continues desert .·” but why is this added
in this place, and by whom is it so? I would suppose it is

Ver. 27: Δυνάστης Κανδάκης τῆς βασιλίσσης Αἰθιόπων· Of
§reat authority under Canclace queen of the Ethiopians] In a
Freneh treatise lately published, that bears the title of
‘ Histoire de la Haute Ethiopie,' p. ¹5, all the Ethiopian
kings are named aud reekoned up, and Candaee not men—
tioned. But- at the end there is this animadversion upon it:
“ Dans cette chronologie il n'est point parle ni de la reine
Candaee, ni de l'imperatrice Helene? 816. In this chronoloyy
there is no mention of tlte queen candace, nor of tlte en‘epress
IIelen .· the Abyssins, no more than the Jews, use not to name
the women in their genealogies; a thing very common with all
the eastern nations.''
