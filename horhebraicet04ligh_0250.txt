ties, seducers, the most wicked of all moi-tal men ς who, he
saith, were ‹rnmdtaef ἐν ἀγάπαις, spots in their ayapae. And
do you think these were of the same ehurch where they so
sasted3 &Vere these admitted without any seruple to the
Αραρω, if they were appendages to the Lord's Supper? For
Jude saith, ἀφόβως ἑαυτοὺς ποιμαίνοντες, feedinsy themselves
withoutsear. How much more probable is it to think that
these strangers were unknown persons, under the form of
believerS‚ wandel-ing up and down, and received in the eom-
mon hospital of the chureh, and there scattering their errors;
and that so much the more boldly, as they were themselves
the more unknown! We are far from denying that some
ayapoe, love seasts, were used as appendages of the Lord's
supper in more ancient ages of the chureh: but whether in
the times of the apostles we ask, and whether J ude means
such, we very much doubt3 and that such are here pointed
out by the apostle we do not at all believe. These banquet-
ings of the Corinthians before the Eucharist, unless we are
very much niistaken, look far another way3 and I sear lest
while some pursue this place concerning the Lord“s supper
with such commentaries of dread and terror that some, being
moved and terrified thereby, do altogether avoid this sacra-
ment as some deadly thing, and not to be meddled with; I
sear, I say, that they do [not] hits upon the fault and error of
the Corinthians in this business, and that they do not reduce
that ἀναξίως, unwortloilys, to their proper crime.

We believe the J ewish part of this chureh, although con-
verted to the gospel‚ yet retained somewhat of their old lea-
ven; and as they -Judaized in other things, so in this about
the Eucharist3 so grievously erring eoncerning the proper
end of it, that they thought it only an appendage of the Pass-
over, or some new or superadded form of the commemoration
of the going out of Egypt. Into which error they might be
the more apt to fall, they especially who were so inclinable to
Judaism‚ both because it was instituted in bread and wine
which wore in the Passover‚ and because they had drunk in
this from their very cradles, “ That the Mossiuh, when he
should come, would banish or change nothing of the rites of
