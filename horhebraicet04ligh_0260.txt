254 Hebrum and Julmudz‘cal [Ch. xii. 8.

Λόγον γνώσεως, the word of knowledqe, we attribute to the
prophets, that is, the knowledsye of things to 001110.

But how do we apply πίστιν, saith, to teachers? That by
fizitlc in this place is not to be understood justffye‘nyficith, is
granted, as I think, by all: and that upon good reason;
when the apostle treats here only of the extraordinary gifts
of the spirit. Nor can Ι, ἱι1ᾰοοᾶ, understand it of the saith
of miracles‚· not of the faz'tla of cloiny miracles, because δυνά-
μεις, miracles, and χαρίσματα ἰαμάτων, ,affl-5 of healinys, are par-
ticularly and distinctly reckoned up: nor of the faitlc of be-
Zz'evz'nq miracles, because the discourse here is of the ways and
persons that actively propagated the gospel, not passivcly
that- received it. By faiflz, therefore, Ι would understand
fiducia, that is, α Ιιοζῃ bolclness, emffldeuce, aud 222a972a722‘2222'l3s„
wherewith those most holy preachcrs of the gospel were
armed, so that they could not bc terrified by any thing nor
by any person. See Aets iv, 133 but especially ver. 29, 31.
And in this sense facille may very well be attributed to
‘ teachers.'

Δυνάμεις, miracles, and χαρίσματα ἰαμάτων, the {lifts of heal-
inqs, are very easily both distinguished and understood. You

have them again so distinguished, Mark vi. 5, and xvi. 17, 18.
‚ Ἀντιλήψεις, lcelps, were they probably who accompanicd
the apostlcS, and baptized those that were converted by
them, and were sent here and thero by them to such placeS,
to which they being employed in other things could not 001110;
as Mark, Timothy, Titus, &e. Thc Talinudists sometimes
call the Levites D'JUDL) ''TNDD ἀντιλήψεις ἱερέων, helps thlte
priests.

Προφητεία, proplcecgs, and ἀντιλήψεις, lcelps, are placed in pa-
rallel according to the order of the apostle; and do agree
indeed excellently well together, if you take propleecy for
preaclcins] .· which is done very frequently.

Κυβερνήσεις, frovermnents, also, and διακρίσεις πνευμάτων, (lis-
cerniny of spirits, stand paralle13 and that they denote one
and the sanie thing Ι scarcely make a doubt. But κυβερνήσεις
in this place to 1110 sounds not {lovel-mazenis, or α power of
rulimy, but it speaks α deep aad prqumnl remla, [solertiam] .·
in which sense it occurs in the Soventy interpreters inore than
once, and answers to the llebrew word ΠἾμῃΠῇ prudent
