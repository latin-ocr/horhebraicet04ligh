Oh. xi. 5.] Exercz'tations upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 231

So J onathan also in J udges v. 1 ς The wise men returned to
sit in the synagogues *372 ΨἾἾΞ with om uncovered head ‚· that
is, not searing their enemies, nor shamed by them.

Men therefore veiled themselves when they pmyed, partly,
for a sign os reverence towards God, partly, to show them-
selves ashamed before God, and unworthy to look upon him.
In which thing that these Corinthians did yet J udaize, although
now converted to Christianity‚ appears sufficiently from the
correction of the apostle.

Of the manner of veiling, see the treatise Moed Kauana,-

woman go with her head uneovered. This is founded in the
Law, for it is said [of the suspected wife], ‘ The priest shall
uncover her head,' Numb. v. 18. And the tradition of the
school of Ismael is, That the daughters of Israel are ad-
monished hence not to go forth with their heads not veiled.”
Andh‚ “Modest women colour one eye with paint.'' The
Gloss there is; ‘⁴ Modest women went veiled, and uncovered
but one eye that they might see, and that eye they coloured.”
‘⁴ Onei made bare a woman’s head in the street ε she came to
complain before R. Akiba‚ and he fined the man four hundred
zuzeesss’

II. But however women were veiled in the stmets, yet
when they resorted unto holy service they took off their veils,
and exposed their naked faces 3 and that not out of lightness‚
but out of religion. &³7:15 &DQ-1 ΝΞῙῬΕ), Tkek three fhasts
