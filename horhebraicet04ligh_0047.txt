ch. iii. 24] Exercitations upon the Acts. 41

begot the difficulty in this place, and occasioned the variety
of versions we meet with: and how the Chiliasts apply these
things is well known. But if our interpretation be admitted,
what could be more fully and plainly said to answer the con-
ceptions of the auditors, who might be ready to object against
what St. Peter had said, ‘⁴ Is it so indeed? Was that Jesus,
whom we have erucified, the true Christ? Then is all our
hope of refreshment by the Messiah vanished, because 116
himself is vanished and gone. Then our expectation as to
the consolat-ion of Israel is at an end: because he who should
be our consolation is pei-islied.” “ Not sc, (saith St. Peter3)
but the Messiah, and the refreshing by him, shall be restored
to you if you will repent: yet so that he himself shall con-
tinue still in heaven. H e shall be sent to you in his refresh-
ing and consolatory word, and in his benefits, if you repent‚''
&c We have something parallel to this in Acts xiii.47:
“We turn unto the Gentiles; for so hath the Lord com-
manded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gen·
tiles.'' Set thee ,9 WVhom? What, Paul and Barnabas? No,
but Thee, Christ„ sent, and shining forth by the ministry of
those two apostles.

And hence it is that I the less doubt of the reading of the
word προκεκηρυγμέυον, prestchecl before ¹um‘o you (whereas some
would rather have it προκεχειρισμένον, ‘made ready) 3 for St.
Peter's design and discourse is about preachiny. He shall
send Christ to you by way of preaching‚ “ as he was before
preached of.'' We may observe, that the apostle in this dis-
course of his instances in a threefold time: 1. The time be-
fore his coming, wherein 116 was προκεκηρυγμέυος, preaclzed be-
fore by Moses and all the prophets from Samuel, and so on.
2. This time when he came, and God exhibited him to the
world (ἀναστήσας αὐτὸν, leaviny raised kim up, ver. 26): raising
him up for a Saviour‚ he sent him to you first, that by his
doctrine 116 might turn every one of you from his iniquities.
And, 3. Now that he is gone up into heaven, and is there to
abide‚ yet God will send him to you that repent in the preach-
ing of his word, as he was before p1·eached.''
