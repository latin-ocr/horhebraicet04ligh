of cattle to be offered to the Lord, whether they were without
spot or no: ofd women's charms to be worn or not on the
sabbath : ofe the knives of the butcher priests, whether lawful
or not: and of divers things of that nature.

IV. When we rendered those words ΓΠὩἾὮ ζῬΝῐΖ] ‘72
the bench not anthemio, we meant it so called, not that the
judgments and determination-s of that bench were of no value,
but that that bench received not its authority from the San-
hedrim, but was chosen by them between whom the contro-
versy depended.

“ Rabh Nachmanf saith, A widow,” (if she would sell some-
what of her dowry,) “hath no need ΓΠὮἾὩ ζῗῖϊ '72 Qf the
bench of the authorz'z‘ed; but hath need mmmm LJL’J '⁸12 of
the bench of idiots,'’ or private men. Maimonidesg citing these
words writes thus3 “ A widow, whether she became a widow
after marriage, 01· after espousal, is bound by oath, and sells
a piece of land of her husband's'' (for her maintemmce),
“either in the court of the mzmnelcin, the authorized, or in
ΓΠΌἾὩ ῙΞἾΝΨ the court of those that are not authorized5 now
that court or bench is, when three men are present that are
honest and skilful in valuing a piece of land.”

To this very ordinary bench among the Jews, the apostle
seems to have respect in this place, and to prescribe it to the
Oorinthians for a means of ending their differences which was
easy, common, and void of cost- and charges.

The bench of the mumehin one may not unfitly call τοὺς
αὐθεντημέυους, such as were deputed by authority: this bench
consisting of ΓΠῺἾΌ ῑΞἾΝῑ) those that were not mzcmclcz‘n, he
calls ἐξουθενημένους, not vile or contemptible, but such as were
not authorizeel. '

He exhorteth, therefore, that if at any time suits arise
among them concerning pecuniary, or other matters, they by
no means run to heathen courts, but rather choose some pri-
vate men among themselves as judges and arbitrators in such
matters.
