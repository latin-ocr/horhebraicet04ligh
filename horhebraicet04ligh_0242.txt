236 Hebrew and Talmudz'cal [Oh. xi. 6, 10.

ΞἾΝ like the qlory of the man, that is, saith he, like the
woman, who is the glory of the husband.” See also the
Targum.

Καταισχύυει τὴν κεφαλήν· Dislzonouretk ker head. ΠἹῐῒῬ
mu {ke liylattzess of the head, among the Talmudists, is levity
or irreverence: and if you should render the Greek expression
in the same sense, as though it were ἹΨΝἾ ἶῖῬζ) 726 vili 68
his head, 01· mmm Πῑνρῃ ska mustos ker head, one should not
much stray either from grammar or from truth. But the
sense ariseth higher; a man praying covered, as ashamed of
his face before God, disgraceth his head, Christ, who himself
carried the like face of a man: especially he disgraceth the
office of Christ, by whom we have access to God with confi-
dence. And a woman praying not veiled, as if she were not
ashamed of her face, disgraceth man, her head, while she
would seem so beautiful beyond him, when she is only the
glory of the man 3 but the man is the glory of God.

Ver. 6 : Καὶ κειράσθω· Lat lzer also be shorn] “ If she be
not veiled, let laer be show-ns* Yea, rather you will say, let her
go with her hair loose, for it was given her for a covering by
nature. Will the apostle suffer this, or any civilized nation 3
By no means. He saith, The hair of women was given them
for a covering, and yet requires another covering ; calling to
mind the primitive reason why the covering of hair is given
by nature to a woman, viz. to bc a sign of her reverence,
humiliation‚ and shame before God. The apostle permits
women to gather and bind up their hair into knots by hair—
laces; a thing done in all nations that wore not fierce and
wild, yca, he would scarce suffer the contrary. But if any
woman was so unmindful or sorgetful why thc veil of her hair
was granted her by nature, and so much assured of her
beauty and her face, as when she prays to take off her veil,
tho sign of hor reverence towards God3 let her take off also,
saith he, that natural sign of roverencc, the veil of her hair.
