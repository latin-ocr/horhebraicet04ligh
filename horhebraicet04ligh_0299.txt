were they so in the times of the apostles3 which were not so
far removed from their first captivity. That- people, therefore,
in that time sknlked [latuit] not in I know not what unknown
land, [a thing now conceived of them] but that the preaching
of the apostles came also to them, as well as to other na-
tione. One may say this with the greatest assurance upon
the credit of St.Ja1nes‚ who writes his Epistle to the whole
twelve tribes, and also upon the credit of the author of thc
Apocalypse, in whom the twelve tribes aie sealed, chap. vii.
And the words of our Saviour argue the same thing re-
specting the twelve¹¹ apostleS, that were to judge the twelve
tribes, implying that they all twelve heard of the sound of
the gospel, concerning the receptior] 01· rejection of which that
judgment was to be.

Under this notion, unless I ani much mffltaken, ie the
apostlo to be understood treating of the calling of Israel,
Rom. xi3 not of the Jews only„ bnt of {lae ‘whole tec-elne tribes
of Israel, ὃωὸεκαφύλου. And this is that mystery concerning
which 110 speaks at ver. 25, namely, that hardness, 01· “ blind-
ness happened to Israel ἀπὸ μέρους 323! parts, 01· sspffl‘ccfelyst'
first, the ten tribes were blinded, and some hundreds of years
after, the two tribes : and both the one and the other reniained
under that state until the sulness of the Gentiles came in,
when the gospel entered5 and ‘so all IsraeL' δωδεκάφυλος,
the whole twelvc tribes, namely, they who were >minna⁵ dhe rem-
nant, κατ’ ἐκλογὴν χάριτως, according] to {lm electiotz of θναεε,
ver. 5, were saved. For those words ἄχρις οὗ τὸ πλήρωμα τῶν
ἐθνῶν εἰσέλθῃ, until thefztblzess of z‘lce Gentiles come in„ are not
so to be understood, as if the gathering of the last handful of
the harvest of the Gentiles were to be expected before that
calling of all Israel: but they are opposed to that seldom
coming in of heathens to true religion before the preaching
of the gospel. For at that time they were added to the
church by drops only, and very rarely : but when the gospel
entered, they flowed in as in a full stream, καὶ ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ πλη-
ρώματι τῶν ἐθνῶν, ancl in tlte whole fedness oftlze Gentiles, And
so (which is a great mystery) first the Gentiles were blinded,
and after them the ten tribes were bhnded, and after them
the two tribes were blinded3 all lying under that miserablo
