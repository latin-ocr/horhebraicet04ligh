to judge. I hope it will not give offence upon this account, that if
Ι mistake I mistake only in historieal matters, (as most of those
things are that here create difficulty) where there is no fear of dash-
ing upon the analogy of faith or the doctrine of the church.

Thatb Ι presume, Right Honourable, to lay these my rude thoughts
before your learned eyes, is not holdness, but duty, gratitude, and
obligation. Ι know well enough such is my meamwss, that Ι am
not able to invent or frame any thing that may be worthy of that
great learning wherewith you arc so signally endowed. But it is
your goodness, with which you are as much endowed, that I and
these my papers have to do with. They approach to pay their re-
spects to it, and to render you all the thanks that possibly Ι can for
that favour, assistance, and pati-onage that your Honour vouchsafed
to aid and comfort me with when I and my affairs lay under adver-
sity and hazard. You, great sir, came in to my succour ; and when
I was wholly a stranger to you, and you to me, yet you gencrously
afforded me your helping hand 3 and that of your own accord, un-
asked, and with an earnest diligence, care, and affection. O, how
much ain Ι indehted to that kindness of yours, and wherewith shall
I requite it? Lct this issue of my studies, whatever it he, serve as a
monument of my vows 3 and having your great name inscribed upon
it, let it live and glory, and testify to all the world the obedience,
duty, and gratitude of,

Right Honourable,
Your most humble and most obliged servant,

ιῙΟΗΝ LIGHTFOOT.
