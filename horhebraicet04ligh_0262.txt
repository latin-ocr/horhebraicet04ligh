Gloss is, ‘⁶ The speech of devils to exorciso them, and of angels
to adjure them.qq The apostle speaks according to the con-
ception of the nation.

they performed one work, and one man pelformed it, they are
called one. The Arack saith, “ They were two balls of brass,
and they struck one against another.''

But now κύμβαλον ἀλαλάζον, α ΐῖηΗίΝῃ cymbal, was when
these two balls were struck one against another without any
either measure or tone of music, but with a rude, inartificial,

We may observe in these instances, which are compared
with charity‚ and are as good as nothing if charity be absent,
that the apostle mentions them which were of the noblest
esteem in the Jewish nation3 as also the most precious
things which could be named by them, were compared with
this more precious‚ and were of no account in comparison
of it.

Ῐ. Λαλεῖν γλώσσαις τῶν ἀνθρώπων, to Speal· willa tlte toozgzues
of men, with those interpreters is, ‘·' to speak the tongues of
the seventys nations‚” or at least to speal( the tongues of many
nations. So thoy relate it to the praise of Mordecai, that he
persectly understood the language of the serentes nations3 and
they require of the Fathers of the Sanhedrim that they be
skilled in many languages, that “ the Sanhedrim hear nothing
by an inte1·preterm.’‘

ΙΙ. Λαλεῖν γλώσσαις τῶν ἀγγέλων· To speak mim the {onyches os
anyels. For this singular praise they extol Jochanan Ben
Zaccai in the example alleged.
