ΙΙΙ. The apostle tolerates an unknown toozyzce if an inter-
preter were present. But Ι scarce believe he would tolerate
that one should prate in Scythian, Parthian, or Arabio, Sne„
when he could utter the same things in the Corinthian lan-
guage, and without the trouble of the church and an inter-
preter.

We are of opinion, therefore, nor without reason, that
thatp unknown language which they used, or abused rather,
in the church, was the Hebrew; which now of a long time
past was not the common and mother tongue, but was gone
into disuse; but now by the gift of the Holy Ghost it was
restored to the ministers of the church, and that necessarily
and for the profit of the churcll. We inquire not in how
many unknown languages they could speak, but how many
they spake in the church; and we believe that they spake
Hebrew only.

How necessary that language was to ministers there is
none that doubts. And hence it is that the apostle permits
to speak in this (as we suppose) unknown language, if an
interpreter were present, because it wanted not its usesulness.
The usefulness appeared thence as well to the speaker, while
he now skilled [calluit] and more deeply understood the ori-
ginal language; as also to the hearers while those things were
rendered truly, which that mystical and sacred language con-—
tained in it.

The foundations of churches were now laying, and the
foundations of religion in those churches3 and it was not the
least part of the ministerial task at that time, to prove the
doctrine of the gospel, and the person, and the actions, and
the sufferings of Christ out of the Old T estament. Now the
original text was unknown to the common people, the version
of the Seventy interpreters was faulty in infinite places; the
Targum upon the prophets was inconstant and Judaized; the
Targum upon the law was as yet none at all : so that it was
impossible to discover the mind of (iod in tho holy text with-
