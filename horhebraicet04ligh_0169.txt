that revolted toqetlaer sacrzficed to tlte calf Βααί. To this sense,
therefore, the words of God to Elijah come: “I have left, or
I have reserved, to myself‚ seven thousand men that have kept
themselves untouched with the common idolatry of the nation
in the adoration τῆς Βάαλ, [of Βααῖ, or] ofJeroboam's eaffi''

then at this present time also there is α remmam, eya] However
we suppose the J ewish nation, asto the more general mass
of it, was cast off before the times of Christ ; yet no question
there was in all ages λεῖμμα κατ’ ἐκλογὴν χάριτος, α remmam
according] to the election of yrace, and in that age more espe-
cially wherein Christ and his gospel began to shine out. And
that he meant the calling of this remmam in that age and time
wherein the apostle wrote, and not any eall of the whole na-
tion to be hereafter, what ean be more plainly said than what
is said in these words, ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ, αϊ this present time ?

Let us take a view of the apostle's reasoning: ‘⁶ ‘ Hath God
east away his people 3² No; for I also am an Ismelite, and
he hath not cast me off. And as in the days of Elijah there
was a remnant‚ even so it is ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ, αἱ {leis very pre—
sent time.” How unfit-ly would this argue that the ealling of
the nation was to be after a great many ages ἓ But if we will
suppose that the Jews had, for the greatest part of them,
been cast off, blinded‚ and hardened, before the times of
Christ and the apostle‚ then this reasoning will run easily
and smoothly: “ Let it be granted that the nation, as to the
main body of it, was east away for some ages past3 yet is it
so east away that there is no hope for any Jew? By no
means. For ἐν τῷ νῦν καιρῷ, at {lais present time, there is a
remnant, as it was in the days of Elijah: I myself am one of
that remnant.''

the meaning both of the prophet and apostle.
