too unworthy, much too mean.

There are, alas! among Christiane, some who come to this
sacrament ἀναξίως, αηωονίίιὶίμς 11111 whether this mzwortlcily
of the Corinthians be fitly applied to them, I 11111011 doubt.
How mean soever I 0111, 101 1110 811001( 11118 freely‚ with the
leave of good and picus men, that I sear that this discourse
of the apostle, which especially 01108118οᾶ Judaizers, is too
severely applied to Christians, that J udaize not at all ; 01 10081
11101 11 18 1101 by very many interpreters applied to the proper
and intended scope of it.

Of these Corinthians receiving 1110 Ε1101101181 umoorthily, in
1110 801180 of which we 8110110, 1110 01108110 speaks two dreadful
things :—

I. That they became ἔνοχοι τοῦ σώματος καὶ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ
Κυρίου, quiltgs oftlw body ancl blood of tlae Lorcl, ver. 27. With
this Ι compare that of 1110 01108110, Ηο11. x, 29, ‘⁴ He hath
trampled under foot the Son of God‚ and hath counted the
blood of the covenant by which he (the Son of God) was
sanctified, a common tl1ing.” And Heb. vi. 6, “ They crucify
again to themselves the Son of (110(1,’καὶ παραδειγματίζουσι, (md
put him to an open skame.'' Of whom 18 1110 (118001118οἓ Not
of all Christians that walked 1101 exactly according 10 the
gospel rule, (although they indeed 08100111 and 11001 Christ
too ignominiously3) but of those that 10101180 and apostatize
from the gospel to J udaism, whither these Corinthians too
much inclined, and are admonished seasonably 10 take care of
the same guilt. For when any professing the gospel 80 de-
clined 10 J udaism, that he put the blood of Christ in subordi-
nation 10 1110 Ρο88ον01, and acknowledged nothing more in it
than was acknowledged in the blood of a lamb and other
sacrifices, namely, that they were a 111010 commemoration and
nothing 0180, oh, how did he vilify that blood of the 01011101
covenant! He 18 qailty of tlte blood of the Lord, who 08801118
10 1110 shedding of 1118 blood, and gives 1118 vote to 1118 death
08 inflicted for 0 ‘mere shadOW‚' and nothing else; which
they did.

themselves. But what 11101 judqmem 18, 18 (100101οᾶ νο1. 3ο;
