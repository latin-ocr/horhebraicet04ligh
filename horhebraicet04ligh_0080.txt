historiam speaking of those threescore and ten persons that
went down into Egypt, “I will reckon them up (saith he),
that I may satisfy those who would pretend we took not our
original from Mesopotamia, but from Egypt.'' It is strange
therefore that the interpreters would add those that were
actually born in Egypt. But it seems that, when they would
confound the true number, they chose those upon the account
of those words in Gen. 1. which we mentioned.

Asd to these children of Ephraim and others, whose story
is mentioned 1 Chron. vii. 20, the masters of traditione tell
some ridiculeus tales of them3 viz. that having not counted
right as to the years of their bondage 111 Egypt, they went to
invade the land of Palestine before the appointed time, and
fell by the sword of the Gittitese: but that they came to
life again with those whom Ezekiel raised from the dead,

Ι have, in my notes upon Luke iii, offered my conjecture
why the interpreter should confound the number, and put
c'lzreescore amlflsteen instead of lln‘eescore (md ten .· as also why
the evangelist should follow that version and that number:
and am of the same mind still. In the meantime, wondering
at their retaining the true number, Deut. x. 22, where Nobi-
lius in his Scholia tells US, ίξ Josephus in his second book os
Antiquities‚ writing of Jacob, hath set the number.''' (l have
quoted the passage already.) “ And St. J erome in his ques-
tions upon Genesis. witnesseth that the Septuagint so writ it.
Other copies have ἐν ἑβδομήκοντα καὶ πέντε ψυχαῖς, threescore
amlfifteen souls.” .

If the Septuagint wrote so in this place, when elsewhere
they have threescore <md fifteen, I know no other reason can
be rendered of it but that Moses is hero introduced speaking
to the people of Israel, who very well knew the certain and
true number; but elsewhere, where it is rendered by them
threescore (md fifteen, he is writing a history for the whole
world, to whom the precise number was not so well known.
But one may suspect the same pen did not translato the Book
of Deuteronomy that had translated the Books of Genesis
and Exodus. So Caphtorc'm in Gen. x. 14, by tho interpreter
