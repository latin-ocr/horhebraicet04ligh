took 1116 father and whole family along with him. But he
departed when 116 removed from Gharran, leaving his father
buried behind him, and Nahor his brother with his family.

father was dead, ⁴8³0] Here ariseth a difficulty, and upon that
a controversy, which we may take in in the words of R. Solo-
111011 upon Gen. xi: “ And Terah died in Oharran, that is,
more than threescore years after Abraham had left (Jharran
and had settled in the land of Canaan. For it is written,
⁶ Abraham was seventy-five years of age when he went out of
Uharran, and Terah was seventy years old when Abraham was

R. Solomon, even while he is defending the contrary, seems
something apprehensive Of} for thus he expresseth himself:
