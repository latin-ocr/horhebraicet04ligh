Ch. vii. 19.] E.z÷ereitatioizs upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 2123

Among many things which may here be spoken, we will ob-
serve onlyb two; one, from the very practice of the J eWS‚ the
other, from the chief end of circumcision.

Ι. You will wonder perhaps, reader, when you hear that
some Jews always went uncircumcised ; yea, that some priests
not circumcised ministered at the altar, and that without the
complaint of any, and indeed without any fault. But the
Fathers of the Traditions themselves do confess this. Very
frequent mention is made in the Talmudists of 5537 ‘’JNWKD'*
cm zinca'rcuvncised Israelita, and ‘7537 1272 an ‘zmwircumcisecl
priest.

“ R. Jochananc in the name of R. Benaiah saith, ‘ They
sprinkle 3753) 373⁵}qu by upon an unce‘remncz'sed Israelz'te.'’'
“ Alld the sacrifices, whose blood is received by an alien, 1752?
the ‘zmcircumcisecl priest lamenting, &Q are not approved. R.
Simeon saith, ‘ They are approved.'’' And, “ R. Lazare in
the name of RHaninah saith, ‘There is a story 3753? ἷΠΞζῑ
of cm unt-irczmzcisecl priest, who sprinkled blood at the altar3
and his sprinklings were approved.'’ “Anf uncircumcised
priest is a priest whose brethren died by circumcision:'’
and g, ‘⁶ an uncircumcised Israelite is, whose brethren died
of circumcision: and yet he is an Israelite, αἶίΙιοαρΙι πησίνοῑιηι-
cised. For the Israelites are not bound to perform the pre-
cepts where death will certainly follow: for it is said, ‘ Laws,
which if a man shall observe them he shall live in them‚' not.
that he die in them.”

Hence if the first, second, third son should (lie by circum-
cision, those that were born after were not circumcised, but
were always uncircumcised, and yet Israelites in all respects,
priests in all respects. “ R. Nathan ¹¹ saith, ‘I travelled to
Caesarea of Oappadocia3 and there was a woman there who
had brought forth male children which had died of circum-
cision‚ the first, the second, the third: they brought the
fourth to me, and I looked upon him, and saw not in him
the blood of the covenant. He advised them to permit him

a little while, though not circumcised3 and they permitte-d
him,” &a
