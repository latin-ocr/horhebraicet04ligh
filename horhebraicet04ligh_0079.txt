Ch. vii. 14] Eaeerce'tcaions upon the A ets. 753

Conceive therefore Abraham born, not in the seventieth‚ but
in the hundred and thirtieth year of Terzth; and that these
words here recited by Stephen were spoken to him in “ Ur of
the Chaldeans;” but those mentioned Gen. xii. 1 spoken in
Uharran, andy thus join the story: “ Terah died in Chai-ran:
men said Grod unto Abraha1n‚” &c.

Ver. 14: Ἔν ψυχαῖς ἑβδομηκονταπέντε’ ΤΙινθθεσονιῑ and fif-
teen souls] The Hebrew copies have it everywhere but
‘⁶ threescore and ten.” So also Jose1)l111s23 εἰς τὴν Αἴγυπτον,
&c. “ He came to Egypt with his sonS, and all their sons;
ἦσαν δὲ οἱ πάντες ἑβδομήκοντα, they were in all clm-eoscore ancl
tens Againa elsewhere, οὗ μετὰ ἑβδομήκοντα τῶν πάντων, ὥσ.
“ wlzo with thr-emove aud ten, all that were with him, going
down into Egypt,’' &c.

So EzekieL Trageed. in Euseb. de Praepar. Evangel.'':

Ἀφ’ οὗ Ἰακὼβ γῆν λιπὼν Χαναιναῖαι)

Κατῆλθ’ εἰς Αἴγυπτον, ἔχων ἑπτάκις δέκα

Ψυχὰς σὺν αὐτῷ·
From tlte time that Jacob, leaving] left thre land of Canama, came
down into eqspt‚ helvin-(J seven times ten 302on with him. So the
very Greek version itself in Deut. x. 223 ἐυ ἑβδομήκοντα
ψυχαῖς, διο. “ Thy fathers went down into Egypt willo three-
scor& (md ten persons ‚7⁹ which is strange, when they have it* in
another place⁰‚ ἑβδομήκοντα πέντε, throescore and-fifteen. We
may easily discern that St. Luke here follows that version
that adds five grandchildren to J oseph, Gen. xlvi. 20, Maehir
and Gilead‚ because of those words, Gen. l. 22, “ the sons of
Machir‚ the son of Manasseh, brought up upon Joseph's
knees:’' and Sutelah, and 'I‘ahan5 and Eden, because it is
said, “ Joseph saw Ephraim's children unto the third genera-
tion.'' Where‚ by the way, I cannot but think it strange
why the Greek interpreters should select these their addi-
tional persons out of the sons of Joseph, rather than any
other of the patriarchs: and further take notice, how, though
they reckon up nine children of J oseph——“ Now the sons of
Joseph which were born to him in the land of Egypt were
nine souls,'’ ver. 27—yet they name but seven. J osephus the
