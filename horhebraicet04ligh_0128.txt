that of Psalm cx. 3 (loth not in some measure fall in here
also; which give me leave to render by way of paraphrase
into such a sense as this: “Thy people shall be a willing
people in the day of thy power : it shall be a willing people in
the beauties of heliness3 it shall be a willing people from the
womb of the morning: thine is the dew of thy youth.” Now
the dew of Christ is that quiekening power of his by which
he can bring the dead to life again, Isa. xxvi. 19, “ And the
dew of thy youth, Ο Christ, is thine :³³ that is, “ It is thine

been weak and unstable kindnesscs, had they terminated in
death: he promises mereies therefore, firm and stable, that-
were never to have end3 because they should be always flow-
