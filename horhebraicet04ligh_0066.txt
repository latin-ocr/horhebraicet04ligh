school, of whom five hundred learned the law, and five hundred
the wisdom of the Greeks, and there is not one (of all that
last number) now alive, excepting myself here, and my uncle's
8011 in Asia.”

I rendered Nl& ΠἚἎ in mys father's school or family,
because of what follows in both places; “They allowed the
family of Rabban Gamaliel the Greek learning, because they
were allied to the royal blood‚’' i. 0. they sprung of the stock
and lineage of David. They permitted that that family should
be brought up in that learning, because it became them for
their honour and nobility to want no kind of learning. But
this they did not freely allow others, and if they did not
permit the wisdom of the Greeks, we can hardly suppose they
excepted the Greek tongue 3 especially when we find it in the
very ternis of 'the decree, “ Let no man teach his son ,ΠἾΞἹἿ
Greek.'‘' Upon what I have already said, I cannot but make
these following remarks :

I. What an effectual bar they laid in their own way against
the reading of the New Testament, when they so renounced
the Greek tongue: which God had now honoured beyond
their Syriae, though they will have that so much graced both
in the law, prophete, and holy writings.

II. That even those who understood little else but Greek
would very hardly admit the reading of the law and the
prophets in their synagogues in the Greek tongue; in that
it was so very grateful to their countrymen, and the decrees
and canons of the elders did either require, or at least per-
mit, an interpreter in the reading of the Bible in their syna-
gogueS.

Ill. Howl probable a thing is it, that those Jews, who
having lived amongst the Gentiles understood no other lan-
guage but the Greek ; for that very thing grew the less valu-
able with their own nation that had retained the common use
of the Hebrew tongue, and were had in some lower esteem
than others.

2. lf therefore they stood so affected towards the Greek
learning, what valne must they have for the Greek tongue?
Grant that it were in some esteem amongst them, because,
indeed, most of the learned Rabbins did understand it; yet
