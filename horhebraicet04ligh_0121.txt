Ver. 10: Ύίὲ διαβόλου· Thou child of the devia] Is not
this much of the same import with that in the Old Testament,
ἰΐὲἶῖἳΞἿΞ son of Belial? 112⁷& nina at first hearing seems
to sound‘ very harshly3 and indeed, at first sight, might
appear as if it signified thefirstborn ofSatom .· but it is given
to a certain Rabbin to his praise, and as a title of honour& in
a far different signification, the word ἶωζζ] taking its derivation
from mm> to decline from.

Ver. 12: Ἀνθύπατος· The deputgst] This is a word much
in use amongst the Talmudists, with a little variation only in
the reading. “ R. Chanina and R. J oshua Ben Levi passed
ΓἾΞἾΡἾ &nimam Ἦᾯ before the ἀνθύπατος, or cleputy (gf
Ooesczrea. He seeingy them rose up to them. His own people
say unto him, ‘Dost thou rise up to these Jews?' He an-
swered them and said, ‘I saw their faces as the faces of
angels2.' ’¹ See the Aruch upon the word.

Ver. 13: φΗλθον εἰς Πέργην τῆς Παμφυλίας· They came lo
Perya in Pamphylia] From Paphos in Cyprus, whether old
or new (both being maritime places situated on the western
shore of the island), they seemed to sail into the mouth of tho
river Cestrus3 concerning which Strabo hath this passagea:
Εἶθ’ ὁ Κέστρος ποταμὸς, &c. ‘⁶ Then there is the river Cesti-us,
which when one hath sailed sixty furlongs, he comes to the
city Perga, near which is the temple of Diana of Perga, in a
high place, where every year there is a solemn convention.'’
Ptolemy also speaks of the river Cestrus,⁴ and of the cataract,
concerning which Strabo hath some mention.

But Melab hat-h ‘'this passage: “ Thence there are two
strong rivers, Oestros and Cataractes: Oestros is easily na-
vigable3 but Cataractes hath its name from the violence of
its running: amongst these is the city Perga‚'' &c One
may justly suspect an error in the writer here, writing Oestros
for Cestros3 and it is something strange that Olivarius hath
taken no notice of it.

We may conjecture there was no synagogue of Jews in
