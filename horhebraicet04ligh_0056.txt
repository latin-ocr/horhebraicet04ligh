after the sight of his eyes doth he judge. Bar-Cozbi reigned
two years and a half3 and said to the Rabbins, ‘I am the
Messiah.' They roply upon him, ‘ It is written of the Messiah,
That he smelleth and judgeth : let us see if thou canst (10 50

as to think to have deceived the Holy Ghost‚ is not easy to
conceive or ις11055. Ηο might understand by the instance
of Grehazi how quick and sagacious the spirit of a prophet
is in detecting all cheats and tricks; and (lid 110 not suppose
