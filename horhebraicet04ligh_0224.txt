as the lexicographers teach, is ὁμοίωμα, α likeness, εἰκὼν, απ
z'nzaye, σημεῖον, α siqu, xapaxrwipwv‘l, α character, σκιοειὸὲς, a
skaclow. Iclols indeed are in the world made of wood, stone,
gold, silver‚ &c.; but οὐδὲν εἴδωλον, there is πο idom there is
no representation or figure of God, and none can be. The
apostle hitherto, as I indeed think, puts on the person of
those who made no scruple in eating things offered to idols;
as though he had said, “ You say, ‘ We know that there is
no representation of Grod in the world, and there is only one
G0d‚’ Sto. Therefore those gravenv images and those various
idols are mere figments of human mistake3 and to offer sacri-
fices to them is a mere invention of men. There is nothing
sacred, nothing of religion in them, because there is no repre-
sent-ation of Grod in them. Shall we therefore, who are under
the liberty of the gospel, abstain from eat-ing that flesh which
the foolishness of men only hath separated from common use,
and offered to stocks and stenes which have nothing of God
in them, but are created only by the same human sottishness'}
Ye say truth indeed, but illy applied, and t all have not this
knowledge.' '' Or if you render it, an idol is nothing] in the
world, it comes to the same sense.

love orfear, Rabba saith, He is free: Abai saith, He is guilty.
Abai saith, He is guilty because he worships it. Rabba
saith, He is free: 1³& ΠἹὲΝἎ why-„³729 Ἣ {f lae take it

The Gloss there is, “Bel1old, his heart is towards God;
although he know that that house is an idol-temple, and he
adores God in it, it is no crime, &c If he see a statue such
as they are wont to set up for the picture of the king, and
