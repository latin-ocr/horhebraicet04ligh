280 Hebraeo aad Talmudical [Ch. xiv. ²9·

I. Perhaps there were in Aquila's house seme which tra-
velled with him from Rome, being driven thence by the edict ¹
of Gaesar, and boarded with him in the same house while they
were in their banislnnent. But what then shall we say of
then] when they went back to Rome to their own dwelling?
and also what shall we say of the clmrclc in the house os
Philemon ἒ

ΙΙ. Οι· perhaps Aquila was the clcurclc's host, as Gaius was
at Corinth; in whose house were other nien and women
appointed to that office with him. And, it may be, he per-
formed the same office at Rome when he went· back. And,
it may be, Philemon did the same at Colosse: and thence
that of the apostle to him, “ Prepare me a lodging,” ver. 22.
ssnt all these things are somewhat uncertain5 nor can one see
where to fix his foot. Let me, therefore, add another conjec-
ture also.

III. It⁰ is well enough known what ΨἿἻΌ ΠἛ, beth mi-
draslo, the divinitys school, or the elzapel, was among the Jews;
and what the difference was between it and {50:217 ΓῬΞ
the synayoque. Now beth midraslc was called also 3225 ³2,

It is the house of the Rabba’ns. Where the Gloss: ‘⁶ thy do
they call ΠἾΨἾἼΌ ’Πῖι ίΙιεε dim'nity schools, ‘be rabbanan ,θ’
namely, Because it is their house for any’ use.” In that place
the Gemarists treat of synagogues set apart for holy use;
and how far it was lawful to put them to common uses,
either when they now flourislmd, or were fallen to decay, and
antiquated as to sacred uses. And concerning the beth
midrash, which was very near of kin to the synagogue, it is
concluded‚ as you see, that it is as the very house of the Rabbin,
teaching in it‘l, and to be used by him for any use.

Mention of the 1:25 Ἦ be rabbanan, or bem ῃιίιῖναεΙι, and
the very thing concerning which we now are speaking, bring
to remembrance the 37⁸3& ’,Ἰ be abidan, of which the Tal-
mudists write ; but in a double and various sense. The men-
tion of it occurs in liczbysl. Avoclak zaram, where it· denotes a
