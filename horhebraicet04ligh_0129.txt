Oh. xiii. 41, 42.] Emer-citatiores upon tlte A ets. 123

Pisidians could understand it. If we say in the Pisidian lan-
guage, it is hardly to be believed the Bible was then rendered
into that language. It is remarkable what was quoted above
out of Strabo, where he mentions four tongues, amongst them
the Greek and the Pisidian distinct from one another. But
this I have already discussed in the notes upon ver. 15 of this
chapter.

Ver. 4¹ ⁸: Ἴδετε οἱ καταφρουηταί, &c. behold, gse despz'sers, εἷα]
Dr. Poeockt here, as alwayS, very learnedly and accurately
examines what the Greek interpreters, Hab. i, read; saving
in the mean time the reading which the Hebrew Bibles ex-
hibit; for it is one thing how the Greek read it, and another
thing how it should be truly read.

Ver. 42 ε Παρεκάλουυ τὰ ἔθυη, Sco. Tloe Gentiles besonyltt, lya]
lt is all one as to the force of the words, as far as Ι see,
whether you render them they besonqllt the Gentiles or tlae
Gentiles besouqht them. The latter version hath chiefly ob-
tained: but what absurdity is it, if we should admit the
former? and doth not the very order of the words seem to
favour it? If it had been τὰ ἔθνη παρεκάλουν, one might have
inclined to the latter without controversy; but being it is
παρεκάλουν τὰ ἔθνη, there is place for doubting. And if it
were so, that the Jews resented the apostles’ doctrine so ill,
that they went out of the synagogue disturbed and offended,
as some conjecture, and that not improbably, we may the
easier imagine that the apostles besought the Gentiles that
tarried behind that they would patiently hear these things
again.

Εἰς τὸ μεταξὺ σάββατον· The next sabbath] l. The word
μεταξὺ, as the lexicons tell us, amongst other things denotes
lzenceforwarcl or hereafter. Now this must be noted, that this
discourse was held in the forenoon3 for it was that time of
the day only that they assembled in the synagogue3 in the
asternoon they met in Beth IlIlclras. Let us consider, there-
fore, whether this phrase will not bear this sense, ‘They
besought that afterward, upon that sabbath, viZ. in the after-
noon, they would hear again such a sermon.' And then,
whether the Gentiles bcsouyht the apostles or the apostles the Gen-
tiles it doth not alter the case.
