But as to the burying of the other patriarchs there, they
have not one word. Benjamin also in his Itinerary, speaking
of Sychem, mentions the sepulchre of Joseph, and none but
that. And so do the Gippi Hebraicio, as the learned Hot-
tinger translates the1n3 “ From Sychem at the distance of a
sabbath day’s journey lies a village called UQNLJZ Belata,
where J oseph the Just, of blessed memory, lies buried.’'

I conceive the reason why the Jews are so silent in this
matter may be, because they sear it would be a reproach to
themselves, and too great an honour for the Samaritam, that
the patriarch's bones should lie amongst them. As to J o-
seph⁹s being buried there, there could be no denial of that,
because the Scripture speaks it in express ternis that he was
buried in Sychem: but it is very grievous for them to ac-
knowledge that all the other heads of the nation and tribes
should lie there, where the apostasy of the ten tribes first
began, and after their expulsion the odious nation of the
Samaritans were seated: and for this very reason one might
argue that Stephen would never have mentioued such a thing,
if it could have been contradicted by them. The masters of
the traditions indeed do tacitly yield that the eleven patriarchs
were not buried in Hebron, when they admitted but four
couples there, viz. Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarab, Isaac
and Rebekah, Jacob and Leahv. And if so, where were
they buried Ξ If we do but consider how the great charge and
care os public affairs was committed to J oshua, who was of
the stock and lineage of J oseph, and from that very relation
had a particular concern with Sychem, probability itself would
argue (were there no other proof sor it), that ho would have
as strict a care of the patriarchs now (lead, as his progenitor
Joseph had had of them while they were yet alive.

Whenceq I cannot but wonder that the Samaritans dwell-
ing in Sychem, having in their letters, sent lately into Eng-
land, made mention of the sepulchres of Joseph, Eleazar,
Phinehas‚ the seventy elders, Eldad and Medad, that are
with thern to this day, should say nothing of the sepulchres
of the eleven patriarchs. But so long as all the other tribes
