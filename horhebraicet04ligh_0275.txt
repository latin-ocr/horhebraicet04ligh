Oh. xv. 8, 20.] Eoeeroitations upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 269

See the story of one James‚ a disciple‚ as he is styled, of
J esus Β.

Ver. 8: “Ωσπερεὶ τῷ ἐκτρώματι, διο. As of one born ont of
dne time, ege] ἰῗΞΞ an untimely birth, Job iii. 16, to the LXX
interpreters is ἔκτρωμαε and, which is to be marked, they
render ἶῆᾮζῡ ιέξᾙζ] αῘιίαῖιίθη untimely birth, ἕκτρωμα ἐκπορεύομενον
ἐκ μήτρας μῆτρὸξ, ἀπ untimely birth, proceediny ont <ff lzz's mother's
womb,· when the word {2019 biclden seems rather ‘co denote
the contrary 3 namely, that. it never went out of its mother's
womb, but was always hidden there. So the Chaldee, &1753
&wyssa yram-r an untimely hirta, bidclen in the wonzb.

Hence the word Fllz’fflffi, very usual among the Talmudists
for α woman bri729z‘729f07·tli an abortioni ΠὩΠΞ ΓὈΞ ΠίὔΞὩΠ
ι’]ἾὩἾ ΠἾΠ Α t woman that comes before her iim-e, and br'inys
forth, in the fiynre of α ὂεαεί, ον α bird· nst ‘'J-nt> 14:127227
ΞΡἾἾΌ mem Ἷὲἕ ΝἾῙὮἬ] Cominy before her time, and ὄνέκ-913119
forth α- sandal, secundine, ον α fianed lump, διο. Numb. xii. 12 ;
Ὠσεὶ ἕκτρωμα ἐκπορευόμενον ἐκ μήτρας μητρὸς, καὶ κατεσθίει τὸ
ἥμισυ τῶν σαρκῶν αὐτῆς· As an untimely birth cominy out of
the nzotlzer’s womb, and devouretb the Ῐιαζῖ of herfleslz.

As though the apostle should say, “ How far am I from an
apostle! As much as some misshapen and deformed lump
brought forth by an abortive birth differs from the shape
of a man.” You may render the words in English more apt
and clear, unless Ι am mistaken in my conjecture, after this
manner: as to α thiny born out of dne firm, than as they are
rendered, as to one born out of due time. Παιδίον μὴ ἐξεικο-
νισμένον, α child not shaped ,· so the LXX in Exod. xxi. 22.

Ver. 20: Ἀπαρχὴ τῶν κεκοιμημένων· The firsffruz'ts of them
that slepa] Although the resurrection of Christ, compared
with some firsffrnits, hath very good harmony with them,
yet especially it agrees with the offering of the sheafi com-
monly called ἾΤΞὯΠ, not only as to the thing itself, but as to
the circumstance of time. For, first, there was the Pass-
over, and the day following was a sabbatio day3 and on the
day following that were tlte firsffl‘uiz‘s offered. So “ Christ
our passover was saerificed.” The day following his crucifixion

was the sabbath, and the day following that, He7 Μία firstfiw'ts
ο] them that slepi, rose again.
