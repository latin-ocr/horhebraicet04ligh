OF QORI NTH ITSELF.

CORINTHa was seated in an isthmus, by the space of five miles
parting the AEgean sea from the Ionian, joining Greece to Pelo-
ponnesus by a strait passageb.

Inc the isthmus was the temple of Neptune 3 and the Isthmian
games every five years, for this cause instituted, as is said, because
the coasts of Peloponnesus are washed with five bays. These plays,
broke off by Cypselus the tyrant, the Corinthians restored again to
their ancient solemnity in the forty-ninth Olympiad.

'rhed bounds of the straits of the isthmus on this side are Lechaeum,
and Cenchreae on the other. The haven of Cenchreae serves for the
traffic of Asia, that of Lechaeum for the traffic of Italy. The haven of
Cenchreae was distant from the city seventy furlongs. The Lechaean
port lay under the city.

KingDemetrius,the Dictator Oaesar, Caius the prince [Caligula], and
Domitius Nero, endeavoured to cut through the straits with a navigable
canal, but unsuccessfullye. Corinth, from that high tower, which they
call Acrocorinthus, beholds both scas. Thatf city, heretofore called
Ephyra, was built by Sisyphus, in that time when Othniel was cap-
tain and judge of the Hebrews. Henceg the tower Sisyphium at
Corinth, from the name of the founder. Fromh the coming down of
the Heraclidae into Peloponnesus, the city was under kings for a long
series: then under yearly princesi 3 afterward under Cypselus, usurp-
ing the government 3 and after him under Periander his son 3 and
after a long space of timek under Philip. Whose endeavours the
Corinthians aided, and so despised the Romans for him, that some
presumed to cast dirt upon their ambassadors as they passed by their
houses. For which crime and other wicked deeds an army was scut
thither by the Romans, and Corinth overthrown by L. Mummius.

Whenl it had a long time lain forsakem it was rebuilt by Julius
Caesar3 who built Carthago also at the same time, and into both,
anciently splendid and famous cities, he brought down colonies of the
