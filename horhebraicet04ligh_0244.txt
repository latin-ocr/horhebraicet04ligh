238 Hebrew and Talmudical [Ch. xi. 10.

1. That he does not here speak in his own sense, but cites
something usual among the Jews; not so much to dictate
some rule for Christian women, as to produce a J ewish custom '
in confirmationa of those things which he had said imme-
diately before.

II. He had said, That ⁴ the woman is the glory of the man,'
that ‘ she was of the mans that ¹ she was made for the man‚’
&c. “And this may testify that which is said among the
Jews, The woman ought to have in her own hand power of
her head, because of the angels.”

III. But now there was among them [mep *ΠῚῸἺΖΙ
(1119θῖ3, or messenyers of &spousalffl who were deputed by this
or that man to espouse a wife for him that deputed him.
Concerning which angels the masters here and there diseourse
largely3 but especially see Kiddushmb .· where it begins thus;

nation confirm, and the Rabbins teach.

V. Hither the reasoning of the apostle in this place seems
to refer, “Woman was created for man,” ver. 9. Which is
proved, O ye Jews, by your own consent; when ye decree
that a woman hath power, and ought to have it in her own
hand, over her own head, because os the aiz-mels of espousals.
Let her bare her face if she will, that she may appear beau-
tiful; let her veil it if she will, that she may appear modest.
She hath free power in her own hands to promote her own
espousal and marriage, that she may be for a man, since she
was created for man.

VI. It is true, indeed, that especially obtained which im-
mediately almost followeth after the words newly alleged,
