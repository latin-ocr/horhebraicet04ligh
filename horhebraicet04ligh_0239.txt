Ch. xi. 5.] Emrcitations upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 233

of Nicodemus lately produced; He wentn into his school
alone privately, and “veiled himself and prayed.” So did
men privately, and women also, on the contrary, baring their
faces privately. A reason is given of the former, namely,
that the men were veiled for reverence towards God, and as
being ashamed before G0d3 but why the women were not
veiled also, the reason is more obscure.

A more general one may easily be rendered, viz, murtam
mmm ΠἻἾτΩΞ that a woman was loosed, or free from the pre-
cept, that is, from very many rites to which men were subJeot5
as from the carrying of fringes and phylacteries, from these or
the other forms and occasions of prayers, and from very many
ceremonies and laws to which men were bound. ‘⁶ R. Meir
saith 0, Every man is bound to these three benedictions every
day: Blessed be God that he hath not made me a heathen ;
that he hath not made me a woman 3 that he hath not made
me ἾἾΞ, stupid‚'’ or unleczrned. But Rabh Acha Bar Jacob,
when he heard his son say, “ Blessed be God that he hath
not made me ἾἾΞ, unlearnecl‚” stuck at it3 and upon this
reason as the Gloss interpretas, ΠἸΕὭ ὍΞ, &³7 rmum nm
'WTFJ Because α heathen and a woman are not capable of the
precept: but ἾἾΞ, α rude or unlearned man is capable. De-
servedly, therefore, God is blessed, that God made him not a
heathen or a woman.”

By this canon, that a woman was loosed from the precept,
they were exempted from covering the face during reli-
gious worship, when that precept respected men, and not
women. But if you require a more particular reason of this
exemption, what reason will you find for it? It is almost an
even lay, whether the canonists exempted women from veiling
because they valued them much, or because they valued them
little. In some things they place women below the dignity,
and without the necessity of observing those or the other
rites : and whether in this thing they were of the same opi-
nion, or that, on the contrary, they attributed more to the
beauty of the faces of women than of men, is a just question.
But whether the thing bend this way or the other, the correc-
tion and warning of the apostle doth excellently suit to this
or to that, as it will appear in what follows. ’
