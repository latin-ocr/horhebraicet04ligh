devoted their enemies to destruction if they overcame them,
as was done by them,'’ Numb. xxi. “ Wheneez is it that
when any, condemned to die by the Sanhedrim, is led forth
to suffer death, another goes forth interceding and saying,
‘I will pay for his redempti0113' whence is it, I say, that he
saith this to no purpose? Namely thence, because it is said,
‘ Every anathema of men shall not be redeemed, but shall be
punished with death? ”

If therefore we inquire into the original and proper nature
of this anathema, it was certainly the destining of some male-
factor to most certain death and destruction. Hence is
that in the Chaldee Paraphrast in Isa. xliii. ult.; where, for

ΞἾΠῖΞ ΞΡΞΓ- Πὲῑῇἔζῇ Ι will deliver Jacoba to anathema, he

renders it, Νζῧῖὢρίἳ ἻΟὩᾺ Ι will deliver him to be slaiw.

And now, in reference to the words Almam-atha, very many
commentators agree that this phrase is a certain form of
excommunication‚ and that it is the highest and heaviest.
‘⁴ Thus (say they) is the extremest kind of anathema marked ;
as though he would say, ‘ Oursed be he to tlze comz'ngy, and in
the coming), of clm Lord.' '²

They assert this to be the third kind of excommunication
among the Jews, and think that it sounds the same with
&mmm schammatlca‚ and interpret &nm mv God cometh to
the same senseb.

But let me, with the leave of so great men, speak freely
what Ι think in this business.

1. I have not found in my reading in any places, although
I have sought diligently, in any Jewish writers that I have
pel-used, where Illarum-atha occurs once for a form of excom-
munication. Nor have I found in any Christian writer the
least sign whereby might be shown in what place or in what
Hebrew author that phrase is found in such a sense. Yea, to
speak out plainer‚ as the thing is, Ι do not remember that I
have found this phrase, Macran-atha, in any sense at all, in
any Rabbinical or Talmudic writer, at any time, in any
place.

II. But those commentators mentioned do silently confess
that Mamm-atha, indeed, in so many syllableS, does not occur
