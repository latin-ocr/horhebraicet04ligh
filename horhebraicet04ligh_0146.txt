gloss at all upon them, and their disciples again to the dis-
ciples that followed them: so that the name, sect, and heresy
of the ›sadduc-ees do not secun to have sprung up till the
second or third generation after Sadoc himself: which, ifI
mistake not, is not unworthy our remark as to the story and
chronology. There was a time when I believed, (aud who be-
lieves it 110ῖὲ) being led to it by the author of Juohasin and
Maimonides‚ that Sadoc himself was the first author of the
sect· and heterodoxy of the &addacem but weighing a little
more strictly this matter from the allegatione I have newly
made out of R. Nathan and Aruclz, it seems to me more pro-
bahle that that sect did not spring up till many years after
the death of Sadoc. Let us compare the times.

The Talmudists themselves own that story that «Iosephus
tells us of J addua. whom Alexander the Great met and wor-
shipped : but they alter the name. and say it was Simeon the
Just. Let those endeavour to reconcile Josephus with the
Talmudists about the person and the name, who believe any
thing of the story and thing itself; but let Simeon the Just
and J addua be one and the same person, as some would have
itq. So then the times of Simeon the Just and Alexander
the Great are coincident. Let Antigonus Socheus, who took
the chair after him, be contemporary with Ptolomeus Lagus.
Let Sadoc and Baithus, both his disciples, be of the same age
with Ptolemeus Philadelphus. And so 1110 times of at least
one generation (if not a second) of the disciples of Sadoc may
have run out before the name of ›S‘adducees took place.

lf there be any truth or probability 111 these things, we shall
do well to consider them when we 001110 to inquire upon what
reasons the &zddnoees received not the rest of the books of
the sacred volume with the same authority they did those of
the five books of Moses. Ῑ ask therefore, first, whether this
was done before the Greek version was writ? You will hardly
say Antigonus, or indeed Sadoc his diseiple, was touched with
this error. He would have been a monster of a president of
the Sanhedrim that should not acknowledge that distinctionr
of the law, “ tho prophets and holy writings.” And it would
be strange if Sadoc should from his master renounce all 1110
011101· books excepting the l‘entateuch.
