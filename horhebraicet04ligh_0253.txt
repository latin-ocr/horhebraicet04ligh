delivered to them that institution, they might observo, that
the scope and end of that institution was the commemoration
of the death of Christ, not any paschal commemoration.

I. Namely, that Christ had said, ‘⁶ This is my body, This
is my blood ;'' to teach that the bread and wine now looked
another way than they had looked when they were used in
the Passover. In that the unleavened bread showed their
hasty deliverance out of Egypt, ancl the wine their joy for
that deliverance: but in the Eucharist, the bread points out
the body of our Lord broken, and the wine, his blood

the old testament, and this sacramental blood of the nexv,
may be demonstrated; and in like manner between this sa-
cramental blood of the new testament and the very blood
of Christ.

Ι. In the striking of the old covenant, Exod. xxiv, there
was blood mixed with water, Heb. ix. 19: and in this sanc-
tion of the new, there was wine also mixed with water.

ΙΙ. Out of Chrisffs side, with blood flowed water, John
