Ch. vi. 2.] Emerez'tac'ions upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 199

III. And what, I pray, is this manner of argning? ⁶ Saints,
in the last day, shall approve the judgment and sentence of
Christ: therefore ye are able to judge concerning those things
which pertain to this life ξ’

We therefore make no doubt that the sense of these words,
Know sese not that tlce saints slzcclly'zccl96 the world ,9 most plainly
is this3 ‘ Know ye not that Oliristians shall be magistrates,
and judges in the world‘K' Which most clearly appears by
these observations :

I. The word ἅγιοι, saints, in the verse before, denotes all
Christians, as opposed to infidels not professing Christianity.
But that all these shall jndge the world with Christ, the
espousers of that opinion will not acknowledge: and then let
a reason be given why they word in this verse is to be taken
in a different and stricter sense than the same word is in the
verse aforegoing.

II. The apostle speaks as of a thing known and confessed3
Οὐκ οἴδατε, Know [ese not? But whence was this known, or to
be known, that Christians should be magistrates, and judges
of the world? Most easily and most plainly out of Dan. vii.
18, 27 ε where when the four heathen monarchies which had
so long ruled the world under their tyranny fell, at length
the rule, and dominion, and empire under the whole heaven,
was to be translated to the people of the saints of the
Most High. In what sense and in what latitude the word
saints is to be taken, one may learn from a very plain anti-
thesis in that chapter. The rule, and the dominion, and
empire under the whole heaven was before belonging to hea-
thens : but under the reign of Christ it was the saints', that
is, the Christians'.

ΙΙΙ. This sense agrees very well with the apostle's argu-
ment: “ Think it not unlawful to decide among yourselves
such differenees as arise among yourselves3 and by flying to
heathen tribunals, do not bring a reproach upon the gospel:
for consider what is foretold by Daniel, which ye know well
enough, namely, that the saints, that is, the Christianus, shall
hereafter possess the dominion and government of the whole
world, as now a long while the heathens have possessed and
do possess it. If they shall one day be endued with a right
