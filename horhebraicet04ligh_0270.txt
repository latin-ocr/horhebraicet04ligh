To the same sense the apostle in this place, τί οὗν {ci-m
voleat therefore is to be done in this case, about the use of an
unknown tonguc? He determines, “I will pray with the
Spirit, and 1 will pray with 1116 understanding.''

So ver. 26 : Τί ἐστιν, ἀδελφοί; What is ic, bretkren 9 that is,
‘ that is to be done in this case, when every one hath a
psalm, hath a doctrine,' &a He determines, ‘⁶ Let all things
be done to edification.”

Προσεύξομαι τῷ πνεύματι, &Q I ἰοἱίί pray with the Spirit,
εἷτα] That is, in the demonstration of the gifts of the Spirit;
and, ⁶ I will pray with the understanding‚' that is, that Ι be
understood by others.

Ver. 16: ‘O ἀναπληρῶν τὸν τόπου τοῦ ἰδιώτου· He that occu-
piem the roem of the unlearned] ΖΔἾἾἻΠ kide'ot, a word very

According to this acceptation of the word ἰδιώτης among
1110 Jews, the apostle seems in this place 1ο distingnish the
members of the chnrch from the ministers‚—privale persons
