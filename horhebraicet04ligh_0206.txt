IV. That which is said by the Apocalyptic, eliap. xx. 4,
agrees with the sense of this place: that when Christ had
bound Satan, he should no inore deceive the Gentiles as he
had done before, by idols, oracles, ἂρ. Thrones are set up,
and judgment is given unto them who sit upon them, that
is, a power and authority of judging, and ruling, and exer-
cising magistracy.

Ver. 3: Οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι ἀγγέλους κρινοῦμευς Know με ποί
tlmt we shall ιγ”ιαῖςχθ ανφριεῖε 9] He saith not, as he did before,
'l'he saints shall judge anyels, but we shall judge them. By
αηῃθίε, all confess devils to be understood. But certainly all
saints, (according to the latitude of that word in the verse
foregoing) that is, all that profess Clxristianity, ‘shall not judge
devils, Nor is this ιῘῑμῖρῖηζ] of (myols to be understood in the
last day. But the apostle speaks of the ministers of the gos-
pel, himself, and others, who by the preaching of the gospel
and the name of Christ should spoil the devils of their eracles
and mols„ should deprive them of their worships, should drive
them out of their seats, and strip them of their dominion.
Thus would God subdue the whole world under Christian
power3 that Christian magistrates should judge men, and
ministers of the gospel, devils: and do not you now judge
among yourselves of some trivial differonees3

certainly under peczmz'ccry juclgynzents, as they are opposed to

Hence is that which we observo elsewhere3 “ capital μείς]-

taken away from Israel in the days of Simeon Ben Jochaib.”
