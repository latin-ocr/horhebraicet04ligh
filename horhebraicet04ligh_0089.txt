the worshipping of idols. But the question is, whether the
discourse in this place is concerned in the idolatry they com-
mitted in the wildemess, οι· that in aftertimes. That it doth
not point at the idolatry in the wilderness these following
arguments seem to confirm:

I. Because there is no mention of any idolatry commit-
ted in the wilderness after the golden calf besides that with
Baal-peor. And it is hardly imaginable that Moloch and
Baal—peor were the same, and that Moloch and Remphan
were not two different idols. Nor is it probable at all that
the sacred historian would have passed over such a piece of
wickedness‚ without taking any notice either of the fault or
punishment3 especially when as everywhere else the history

. of their idolatry is related so very accurately. But not to

multiply arguments,

ΙΙ. If Stephen refer this idolatry of the Israelites to the
times after those in the wilderness, and in that sense inter-
prets the prophet, he speaks the same thing that was com-
monly known and received amongst the J ews3 viz. that the
punishment of that sin of the golden calf descended and was
derived to following generations. ‘⁶ R. Oshaiahh saith, that
to the times of J eroboanl the children of Israel sucked of one
ca]f‚'’ (the Gloss is, Viz. that calf they made in the wilder-
ness 3) “ but from that time forward they sucked of two, and
of a third too‚” (the Gloss is, Those two of 0Jeroboam's‚ and
the third of the wilderness.) ‘⁶ R. Isaac saith, There is not
any instance of vengeance that comes upon the world wherein
there is not a twenty-fourth part of a pound of the first calf.
According as it is said,* ‘ In the day that I visit, I will visit
their sin upon the1n,’ Exod. xxxii. R. Chaninah saith. After
twenty-four generations'‘ (the Gloss hath it, In the reign of
king Zedekiah), ‘⁶ this verse was accomplished, as it is said3
‘ He cried in mine ears with a loud voice, The visitations of
the city draw near, every man having his destroying weapon
in his hand, ' Ezek. ix, 1.''
