234 Heln-ew and Talmudical [Oh. xi. 5.

Καταισχύνει τὴν κεφαλήν· Dislzonoureth her head] ‘⁴ Dis-
honoureth her head „9” What head? That which she carries
upon her shoulders3 or that to which she is subjected3 as
the man to Christ, the woman to the man. That the apostle
is to be understood especially of the latter appears from the
verse before, and indeed from the whole context. For to
what end are those words produced, ver. 3, “I would have
you know that the head of the woman is the man,'’ &c. un-
less that they be applied, and make to the apostle's business,
in the verses following?

Nor yet is the subjection of the woman and the supe-
riority of the man all that by and because of which the apo-
stle concludes that a woman must not pray but veiled, and a
man the contrary. For if it were so argued by him, Let not
a woman pray but with her head covered, because she is sub-
ject to her husband ; it might be argued in like manner, Let
not a man pray but with his head covered, because he is sub-
ject to Christ.

I fear lest that interpretation which supposeth the veiling
of women in this place as a sign of the woman's subjection to
her husband should more obscure the sense of this place,
obscure enough indeed of itself. So one writes Ρ, “ A woman
ought to have a covering, that she may show herself humble,
and to be subject to her husband.'’ And anotherq, “Now
the reason of the veiling of women is because they are subject
to men,'' &c. “ A veilr‚ by which is signified that the wife is
in the power of the husband.” And lastly, “ AS veil, whereby
is signified that she is subject to the power of another.” And
very many to the same sense. But let me ask,

I. Where, I beseech you, is a vcil propounded as a sign of
such subjection? Itis put indeed as a sign os true modesty,
Gen. xxiv. 65, and of dissembled modesty, Gen. xxxviii. 14:
but where is it used as a sign of subjectioni

ΙΙ. Hair was given to our grandmother Eve for a covering,
(as the apostle clearly asscrts in this place,) from the first
moment of her creation, before she was subjected to a hus-
band, and heard that “ He shall rule over thee ;” yea, before
she was married to Α dam.
