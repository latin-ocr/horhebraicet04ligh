146 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xxiii. 9.

month Adar fell upon a sabbath; and the new moon did not
appear in its time. And the Baithuseans were desirous that
the first day of the Passover should fall upon the sabbath,
that the sheaf-offering might fall upon the first (lay of the
week3 and so the day of Pentecost upon the first day of the
week also.”

Who now should these Baithuseans be, Sadducees, or
Samaritam, or Christians, or some fourth sect? The Christ-
ians, indeed, would have the day of Pentecost on the first day
of the week ς but whether they mean them in this particular
let others judge. In other things otherwise. “ Whereforei
do they adjure the high priest ?'’ [viZ. that he rightly perform
the servicek of the day of expiation z] ‘⁶ Because of the Bai-
thuseans, who say, ‘ Let him burn incense without, and bring
it within? There is a story osa certain person that burnt
incense without and brought it within . . . . Concerning whom
one said, I should wonder if he should live very long. They
say that he died in a very little time after.’' You would believe
this was a high priest ancl a Baithusean.

were of the ‚Plcm‘isees’ para] For there were also “ scribes of
the Sadducees' part :⁷³ and on both parts the γραμματεῖς,
scribes, must not be distinguished either from the Pharisees
or from the Sadducees that were now present in the San-
hedrim: but the meaning is, the scribes that were of the sect
or profession of the Sadducees, or of the Pharisees; and by
this twofold division the whole Sanhedrim is to be understood.
But if we would take the thing more strictly, there were in
the Sanhedrim some scribes who took the part of the Phari-
sces against the Sadducees who yet were not of the sect os
the Pharisees. I should believe the Shammeans and Hillel-
ites were all against the Sadducees3 and yet I should hardly
believe all of them of the sectos the Pharisees. We find them
frequently disputing and quarrelling one against the other in
the Talmudic writings; and yet I do not think that either the
one or the other favoured the Sadducee, nor that all of them
bore good-will to Pharisaism. There is a bloody fight between
them mentioned¹; “ The Sl1a111111eans” (who at that time were
