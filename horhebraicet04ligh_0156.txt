aad tlze men οἵ ᾸΙαιιιιταιιῖα, that wall-1 naked in the streetS.
Nor is there any thing more loathsome and execrable before
God than he that goes naked in the streetsy.”

Ver.4: ‘H δίκη ζῇν οὐκ εἴασεν· Venyecmce szqfferetlz not to
live] That of thc ‹Jewish writers is not much unlike this²z
“ Although the Sanhedrim is ceased, yet are not the four
‹leaths ceased. For he that deserves stoning either falls from
his house, or a wild beast tears and devours him. ΗΘ that
‹leserves burning either falls into the fire or a serpent bites
him. He that deserves cutting off with the sword is either
betrayed into the power of a heathen kingdom or the robbers
break in upon him. ΗΘ that deserves strangling is either
suffocated in the waters or dies by a squinancy.”
⁴ Ver. 5: Ἀποτινάξας τὸ θηρίον εἰς τὸ πῦρ, &c. He slcook off

Ver. 11¹²: Παρασήμῳ Διοσκούροις· Whose δίψη was Castor
αιιιῖ Pollam] Gemini in the zodiac‚ commonly pictured sitting
upon horses. And so they appeared (if we will believe the
historian) in that fight at the lake Regillus, leading on the
Roman horse, and so pressing upon the enemy, that under
their conduct the victory was obtainedc. But another time
the pseudo-Castores, false Castor and Pollux, appeared not so
