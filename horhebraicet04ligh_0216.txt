210 Hebrew aml Talmudical [Oh. vii. 11.

“ In the day N.‚ of the week N.‚ of the month N.‚ of the
year N. N.‚ the daughter of N.‚ put away before us and
said : ‘ My mother or my brethren deceived me, and wedded
me, or betrothed me, when I was a young maid to N.‚ the son
of N. But I now reveal my mind before you that I will not
have him‚⁷' Sto.

II. Among them also there was departing from each other
by mutual consent: “Αἱ good man had a good wife3 but
because they had not children ΓΠ D& ΓΠ ἾΨἾἎ they mzotually
put army one another. That good man married a bad wife,
and she made him bad. That good woman married a bad
husband, and she made him good.”

They allow also the same license to the heathen. ι11110-
chanank saith, The sons of Noah have not divorce, but 'small
Πῖ ΠΝ ru they put away] one another.

III. To omit the departure of the wife from the husband
for the causes of lust, as Herodias departed from Philip to
be married to Herod, and Drusilla from ΑΖίΖ, and married
Felix1‚ a perverse wife might compel her husband to put her
away. “ Am wife which refuseth to lie with her husband is
called rviam rebellious‚· and they demand of her, Why she
is so rebellious ¹1. If she answers, ‘ I despise him, and cannot
endure his bed :' they compel him to put her away for a
time.’' Yea, R. J ochanan⁰ saith, “ A wife may put away her
husband.’'

Those departures‚ therefore, the apostle altogether forbids.
And when, ver. 11, he saith, ἐὰν δὲ χωρισθῇ, but and {f she de-
part, he doth not so much tolerate them, as supposes them to
happen, and provides against them all, as much as may be, by
the following rules: “ Let her remain unmarried‚ or be recon-
ciled to her husband.''

Ver. 1 1: Τῷ ἀνδρὶ καταλλαγήτω· Be reconcilecl to laer husband]
Compare Deut. xxiv. 4, “ Her former husband, which sent her
away, may not take her again to be his wise.” For the bond
which was there made is not dissolved hero. 37'10522 alm:
