gave the name of Barnabas ,· it may be questioned whether
they did the name of Barsabas or no: because there is a
Judas Bal-sabas also, in Acts xv. 22.

It is uncertain whence the name Barnabas is derived; and
so much the more, because it is uncertain what the word
παράκλησις should signify in this place. lt is generally inter--
preted, the son of consolation, In the Syriae, &Num &523
whence by a long deduction they would make ΝΞ] naba. I
contend not3 but when παράκλησις equally signifies exhorta-
ίὶοη as well as consolation ,· and the apostle expressly distin-
guisheth it from παραμυθία, consolation, 1 Cor. xiv. ’ᾗς it seems
more probable to take its original from §2122 lo prophesy:
under which word every one knows eoelmrtation is compre-
hended in the first place3 and according to this signification
of the word παράκλησις we find him behaving himself, chap.
xi. 23, παρεκάλει πάντας, &a “ He exhorted them all, that· with
purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.'’

Κύπριος τῷ γένει· Of the country] of Cyprus] So the two
apostles of the Gentiles have Gentile countries for their native
soil. Paul in Cilicia, Barnabas in Cyprus: where he also
sold his land; for it is a question whether he could have sold
it in the land of Israel; as also whether he, being a Levite‚
was capable of possessing any land that had not belonged to
the cities of Levi, which could not be sold in the sanie
manner that other lands were. Nay, “ It was not lawful for
an Israclite to part with the land of lzis inheritance, unless
constrained to it by his poverty: according as it is said, If
thy brother should become poor, and sell his possession ‘5¹’ &cb
Here lands are sold, not so much upon account of their own

poverty, as the poverty ‘of others.
