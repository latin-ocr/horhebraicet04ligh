VER. 2 : ‘O δὲ ἀρχιερεὺς Ἀνανίας· The myli priest Ananias]
It is a question among some expositors whether this Ananias
be the same Ananias that J osephus mentions that was high
priest3 and I ask again, whether ἀρχιερεὺς in this place be
· to be necessarily rendered hiala priest.

I. That Ananias, the high priest whom Josephus mentions b,
was sent bound to Rome by Quadratus the governor of Syria,
to render an account of his actions to Claudius Caesar, and
that before Felix entered upon the procuratorship of J udea ;
but whether he ever returned to Jerusalem again is uncertaim
still more uncertain whether ever restored to his place of high
priest: and most uncertain of all whether he filled the chair
at that time when Paul pleaded his cause, which was some
years after Felix had been settled in the govermnent, Acts
xxiv. 10.

ΙΙ. About this time there was one Ananias, a man very
much celebrated indeed, but not the lciylz priest, only the safyan
of tlte priests, concerning whom the Tahnudic writers record
these passages z “ There were thirteen corban chests, thirteen
tables, thirteen adorations in the temple: but to· them that
were of the house of Rabban Gamaliel ΠὊΞΠ ’Ἴ ΠἮ blm

sagan of the priests, saithd,'’ Sco. “Ananias, sagan of the
priests, was slaine in the time of the destruction (of J eru—
salem), with Rabban Simeon the son of Gamalielf.'’ “ R.
Ananias the sagan is said to be slain on the five-and-twen-
tieth day of the month Sivan, together with Rabban Simeon
Ben Gamaliel and R. Ismaelg.” ⁴

If we cannot reconcile the Ananias in Josephus with this in
St. Luke, let Ananias the sayan be the Ananias mentioned
in this place, who may very well be called ἀρχιερεὺς, or lcisyli
