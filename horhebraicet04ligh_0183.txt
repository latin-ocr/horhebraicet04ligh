Σοφία τοῦ Θεοῦ, the wisclom. of God, is not to be understood
that wisdom which had God for its author, but that had God
for its object : and is to be rendered wisdom about Gocl„
There was among the heathen σοφία τῆς φύσεως, τοιῗειίοηι about
natural thinys, and σοφία τοῦ Θεοῦ, wisdom about θοαί, that is,

drivinz‘ty. “ But the world in its divinity could not by wisdoln
know Gods‘·

oschis world] The apostle mentions a fourfold wisdom .-

I. Hea-then wisdom, or that. of the philosophers, chap. i. 22:
which was commonly called among the J eivs ΠἚἹἿ ΠὮΞΠ
Grec-ian wisdom. Which was so undervalued by them, that.
they joined these two under the same curse: “ Gursed is he
that breeds hogs3 and cursed is he who teachcth his son Gra«
οἱαπ ῖοέεσίοηιμ.”

II. Jewish wisdom : that of the scribes and Pharisees who
crucif-‘led Christ, ver. 8.

III. The wisdom of the gospeL ver. 7.

lV. The wisdom τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου, of &lais world: distin-
guished as it seems from the rest, where thais world is to be
taken in that sense, as ΓΠΠ ΞῘῬὋῙΓἾ ie, as it is opposed to
ΝΞΠ &wyri tlae world ΐο come. And he speaks of the last:
and highest- wisdom, which who is there that could obtain ἐν
αἰῶνι τούτῳ, 'ite tlcis world, before the revelation of the gospel
in the coming of Christ, which was αἰὼν ὁ με’Λλωιν, the world
το come? A nd this is that the apostlc does, namely, to show
that the highest, yea, the soundest wisdom of the ages before-
going, was not in any manner to be compared with the bright-
ness of the evangelie adsaloni.
