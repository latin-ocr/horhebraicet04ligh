242 Hebrew and Talmuclieal [Ch. xi. 21.

He that should deny such charitable feasts to have been
used in the chureh together with the eucharist, certainly
would contradict all antiquity: but whether those feasts were
these Ayapce of which the apostle J ude speakS, whether those
feasts had Christ or his apostles for their authors, and whe-
ther these Corinthian feasts were such, if any doubt, he doth
it not without cause, nor deth he without probability believe
the contrary. Of these Corinthian feasts, hear what Sedulius
saith: “Among the Corinthians (saith he) heretofore, as
some assert prevailed an ill eustom, to dishonour the churehes
everywhere by feasts, which they ate before the Lord’s obla-
tion. Which supper they began a-nights‚ and when the rich
came drunk to the eucharist, the poor were vexed with
hunger. But that cust0m, as they repert, came from the
Gentile superstition as yet among them.” Mark that; l
should say, ‘From the Jewish superstition.' The very same
is in Primasius.

II. If I may with the good leave of antiquity speak freely
that which I think concerning the Agyapcc, of which the apo—
stle J ude speaks, take it in a few words :

These Ayapoe, we suppose, were when strangers were hos-
pitably entertained in each church‚ and that at the eost of
the church. And we are of opinion that this laudable custom
was derived from the synagogues of the Jews. “ In¹¹ the
synagogues they neither eat nor drink, &c But there was a
place near the synagogue in which travellers were wont to
sleep and eat.” Hence that in Pesaclcino, where it is asked‚
Why they consecrate the day (which was usual over a cup of
wine) in the synagogue3 And it is answered, 0⁸17an 'DWDNlD
num: *22 ³2:1³ 'mun ihm-i 31³an ''l'' That travellers also
may clo their duty, wlco eat, and (lr‘e'nk, ancl feast in the syna-
yoyzce. Here the Glosser inquires, NVhether it were lawful to
eat and drink in the synagogues, when it is forbidden by an
open eanonl‘. And at length among other things he an-
swereth thus ; snum: ’Ξ ηρ neam-1 nin& emme ειη-ιη
“ ΤΙιε chambers which joined to the sfflzayogme are called syna-
yoyues also, and from thence travellers heard the consecration.”
There was, therefore, a certain hospital either near or joining
