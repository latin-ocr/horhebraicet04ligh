awos, that, on the Passover-m'yhts theg( should eat ‘ea-leole kc‘ds
roasted .· the Gloss is, “ the trotters, legs,'’ &a The wise men
sent to him, threatening excommunicatiom because he taught
lsrael ’ς’ἾΠΞ ΞἺΨἹἻΡ ‘mimz to eat lwly thinjys without, i.e. the
Passover, at Rome3 which it was not lavfful to eat but at
Jerusalem: for, as the Gloss hath it, “ Whosoever should see
kids so roasted would conceive they were consecrated for
paschal lan1bs.” l am very apt to believe that the procoenium,
or meal before the Lord's supper, 1 Cor. xi. 21, might be some
such thing as this.

Can we suppose now that Gamaliel could have either of
these Tlcezcdases in his eye? Indeed, neither the one nor the
other has any agreeableness with that character that is given
of this Theudas about whom we arc inquiring. That in
J osephus is much more adapted 5 and grant only that ‘the
historian might slip in his chronology, and there is no other
difficulty in it. Nor do Ι indeed see, why we should give so
much deference to «Iosephus in this matter, as to take such
pains in vindicating his care or skill in it. We must (for-
sooth) find out some other T kemlas, οι· change the steps in
the verses, or invent some other plaster for the sore, rather
than J osephus should be charged with the least mistak03 to
whom yet, both in history and chronology, it is no unusual
thing to trip or go out of the road of truth. I would therefore
think that the Theudas in J osephus is this same in Gamaliel3
only that the historian mistook in his accounts of time, and
so defaced a true story by false chronology.

Ver. 37 : Ἰούδας ὁ Γαλιλαῖος· Judas ofGaliZee] In Josephus
it is Ἰούδας Γαυλαυίτης, Juclas the Gaulcmitet; and yet, in the
title and inscription of that chapter it is περὶ Ἰούδα τοῦ Γαλι-
λαίου, concerniwy scedas of Galilem which hath elsewhere oc-
casioned a question, Whether some part of the country beyond
Jordan went not also under the name of Galilee? But I shall
not repeat it herc.
