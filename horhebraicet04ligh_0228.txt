ashes; some killing the sacrifice; others sprinkling the blood;
others laying the pieees of the sacrifice upon the altar, &c-
Concerning which see the tract Tamidb.

Προσεὸρεύω signifies also to lay snares, which may also be
applied to that emulous diligence. wherewith they did, as it
were, lay suares for the altat-3 contending in former times
who should first go up thither to take away the ashes, and to
make the fire, &o.; eotncerning which these things are related:
‘⁴ InC former times whosoever would clear the altar of its
ashes did it (in the morning): but when many strove toge-
ther about that business and ran and went up by 1732: the
ascen& of the altar, &a There was a time when two strove
together, and ran with equa] speed, and went up by the aseent
of the altam and one thrust the other, so that he fell and his
leg was broke,” &a

Ver. 21: Τοῖς ἀνόμοις ὡς ἄνομος· Το them that are without
law, as without laza] He distinguished, as it seems by the
verse before, between the ‘ Jews,’ and those that are ‘ under
the law ε’ which may be understood of the Jews in general,
and of the Pharisees in particulam because the Pharisees
seemed more to subject themselves to the law than the rest of
the nation. But by ἀνόμους, such ces are without law, whether
he means the Sadduoees, who altogether opposed the laws of
Pharisees, or whether the heathen, inquire. How he could
yield himself conformable to the hoamen, it is not easy to
judge. To the Jews, the Pharisees, the Saddueees, he might
conform himself in some things without scruplc, that he might
gain them: this only being understood of the SadduceeS, that
his conformity is to be understood in rites, not in the heresy
about the resurrection.

Ver. 27: Μήπως ἀδόκιμος γένωμαι· Lest I should be a cast-
away] Ἀδόκιμος may well render the word ὶῗἾΞΞι, a word very
usual among the master-33 especially as it is opposed to the
word amn: for nm: denotes δόκιμος, that is, approved, fit,
either thing or person : hwa, on the contrary, denotes ἀδόκι-
μος, not approved, notfit.
