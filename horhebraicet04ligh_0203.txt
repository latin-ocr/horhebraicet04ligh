Oh. vi. 2.] Emere-itations upon 1 Epist. Cot-inde. 197

Jews converted to Christianity3 Let us take an example in
this Corinthian church: it consisted of ‚Jews and Gentiles

now converted. The Jews, while they believed not, had in

their synagogues ’λ ἷΐζῑ] ’ἾΞ tlte bench of three, who judged

περὶ τῶν βιωτικῶν, concerm'ny tlcz'ozys perminii& to this Z'lfiv' and
that by the permission of the Roman empire. Now they were
translated into a Christian synagogue, or congregation, and,
with them, Gentiles who believed. W'as that denied them by
the Romans in a Christian congregation which was granted
them in a synagogue'}

FirstS, There was no perseeution at all as yet raised against
the Christiane by the Romans when the apostle wrote these
things: for not· a few years passed before Nero brake forth
into that wickedness.

Secondly, The Romans little cared to distinguish between
a Judaizing synagogue of the Jews, and a Christianizing syna-
gogue of the Jews. And that of Gallio was as the business
was indeed, “ Look ye to it3 for l will be 110 judge of such
mattersf' Acts xviii. 15. It was free for them to judge of
⁶ names and matters of their law!

Therefore these Corinthians were worthy of reproof, in
whose power it was freely to exercise such judgments among
themselves 3 yet, to the seandal of the gospel and the Christian
name, betook themselves to heathen courts of justice.

Ve1¹.2: Οὐκ οἴδατε ὅτι οἱ ἅγιοι τὸν κόσμον κρινοῦσις Isnow
με not that tlte saints shall judye the world ἓ] This place is
wrested to a twofold opinion. By the Fifth Monarchists
[Clc‘ilictstis] into Ι know not what sense3 which l would rather
you should ask them than expect from me. By others into
this opinion, that ‘⁴ tha saints in the last judgment shall sit
together with Christ, and shall approve his judgment.'⁷ And
to this they bring those words οἵ our Saviour, Matt. xix. 28,
Luke xxii. 30, “When the Son of man shall sit in the throne
of his glory‚ ye also shall sit upon twelve tlirones,'' διο.

Ι wonder the verses of so illustrious and notable a subject
as that is which we now handle, and that which is now quoted,
are so much strained from their proper and genuine sense: let
me speak it by the leave of the learned. Let us first· weigh
the words of our Saviour.
