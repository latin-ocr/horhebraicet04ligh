would you have a parallel of a doctrine and building of
straw concerning which Paul speaks? ‘⁴ Thox Rabbins deliver,

saud and stram willa lime, it is allowed? The tradition re.-
spects the times after the destruction of the Temple, when, by
reason of the mourning for that fatal overthrow V, it was not
permitted them to whiten their walls bnt to let them be
overrun with blackness, as a colour fit for mom-ners. T here-
fore it was not permitted to whiten the walls with lime only,
lest they should look too bright: bnt if they were mixed with
sand and straw, whereby the whiteness of the lime might be
darkened, then it was permitted. A doctrine of straw truly,
from a superstruction of straw; and that yields a very fit
image of those J ewish doctrines of which the apostle speaks,
clouding the brightness of the gospel.

V ER. 6 : Μετεσχημάτισα εἰς ἐμαυτὸν καὶ Ἀπολλώ· Ι have ‘ln' a
fimare transferred to myselfaml to Apelles] And why not to
himself and Cephas? From this very place. if it may not else-
where be proved, it appears Peter taught not at Corinth. The
apostle treats purposely of their principal ministers3 and it is
past belief that he would pass by Peter, if Peter had preached
among them.

NVhen he saith that ‘ he transferred these things in a figure
to himself and Apollos,' he understands not the ehanging of
names and persons3 nor (loth he transfer the names of others
into his person and Apolloss that he might not reprove any
by name, (which sense is commonly fixed to this place;) but
the figure which he nseth is this; namely, while he speaks of
that preaching of the gospel which was plain, and rude, and
very distant from human wisdom3 and on the contrary, of
that preaching which was elegant, well studied, and more pro-
found 3 these things, saith he, l have transferred in this
scheme to myself and Apollos, the former way of preaching to
myself, the latter to Apollos
