eh. x. 10.] Emercitations upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 5225

many benches, I pray, were set up? or how many days wore
spent in putting to death a thousand men under that provi-
sion, “ Let one bench put to death only one man, or at most
two, in one day3”

Our apostle, therefore, speaks with the Vulgar: and saith
not definitely three-aozd-twenty thousand perished just to a man,
but three-aml—twenty thousand at least 3 when, according to that
vulgar canon, it is scaree credible that a thousand men were
put to death by those benches ; when one bench put to death
only one, or two at most, in the space of one day.

The Levites, being number-ed presently after the plague of
Baal-peor, were just so many as the apostle here numbers,
Numb. xxvi. 62. So a number, equal to the whole tribe of
Levi, perished in one day.

Ver. 10: Ὑπὸ τοῦ ὀλοθρευτοῦ· Of the dem-oyen] The J ews
call evil angels ΠῖἳλΠ Όζὴῌῃ anyels ὀλοθρευτὰς, destroyers:
and good angels 1¹5sz ''mlm anyels λειτουργικοὺς, minsisteriny.
But Ι inquire, Whether the apostle speaks to this sense in
this place. F orl where can we find the people destroyed and
slain by an evil mayel? They perished indeed by the pesti-
lence, and by the plague for Baal-peor‚ concerning which the
apostle spake before : but here he distinguisheth the destroy-
ing of them by the destroyer from that kind of death. There—
fore the apostle seems to nie to allude to the notion very
usual among the Jews concerning the anyel of death, the
great destroyer, called by them Samael, concerning whom,
among very many things which are related, let us produce
this only:

Am question is propounded of a cow delivered to a keeper,
hired with a price, carefully and faithfully to keep her. She

that is, by no violent death: it is demanded, how far the
keeper is guilty? and it is determined that if she had perished
