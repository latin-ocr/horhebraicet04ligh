Oh. xi. 5.] Exercitationis upon 1 Epist. Corinth. 235

III. The apostle treats not of wives alone, but of women in
general, whether they were wives, virgins, or widows.

IV. The obligation of subjection towards the husband
follows the woman ever and everywhere; ought she ever and
everywhere to carry a veil with her, as a sign of that subjec-
tion? Must she necessarily be veiled while she is about the
affairs of her family? Must she be veiled in the garden‚ in the
fields, walking alone or with her family? It is clear enough
the apostle speaks of veiling only when they were employed in
religious worship ; and that regard is had to something that
belongs to the woman in respect of Godt, rather than in
respect of her husband. And although we should not deny
that the veiling of the woman was some sign of her subjec-
tion towards her husband, yet we do deny that the veiling,
concerning which the apostle here speaks, hath any regard
to it.

V. The Jews assign skama as the reason of the woman’s
veiling: “ thyu does a man go abroad with his head not
covered, but women with their heads covered? R. J osua
saith, It is as when one transgresseth and is made ashamed3
she therefore goes with her head veiled.” Behold a veil, a
sign indeed of shame, but not of subjection. And they fetch
the shame of the woman thence, that she first brought sin
into the world.

Therefore the apostle requiresx the veiling of the woman
in religious worship, by the same notion and reason as men
veiled themselves, namely, for reverence towards God. But
certainly it may be inquired whether he so much urgeth the
veiling of women as reproves the veiling of men. However‚
by this most fit argument he well chastiseth that contrary
custom and foolishness of man : as though he had said, ‘⁶ Do
ye not consider that the man is δόξα Θεοῦ, tlte ylory of God?
but the woman is only δόξα ἀνδρὸς, the ylory of the man ,9 that
woman was made for man? that man is the head of the
woman? and then how ridiculous is it that man should use a
veil when they pray, out of reverence and shame before God,
and woman not use it, whose glory is less! γυνὴ δόξα ἀνδρὸς,
the woman is the [ylorffs of the manf' So R. solomon Y, ΠἻξῆ-ΞΓῸ
