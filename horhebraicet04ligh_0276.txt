270 Hebrew (md Talmudc‘cal [Oh. xv. 29.

Ver. 29: Oi βαπτιζόμενοι ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν· They which are
baptized for the death] I. In this sense you may best under-
stand these words: “ Otherwise what shall they do who
undergo martyrdom, and are bapte'wcl in that sense, as bap-
tism denotes death by martyrdom, if the dead are not at all
raised Γ For,

I. That baptism is taken sor martyrdom appears enough,
Matth. xx. 22, 23.

II. See how very well the connection of the following verse
agrees to this sense: “ What shall they do who have under-
gone, and do undergo martyrdom, if thore be not a resurrec-
tion? Τι’ καὶ ἡμεῖς κινδυνεύομεν; ‘and why do we also every
day and every moment syo in (lawyer of martyr-dom ζ’ ”

ΙΙΙ. He argues from them that die in Christ, that is, in the
saith of Christ, ver. 18. And do you believe he would omit an
argument from those that die for the saith of Christ?

IV. He saith, τί ποιήσουσινς what skalt they (ἶο ,9 Not ποι-

οῦσιν; what do they? Not what they mean, or denote, or
⁴ signify by this that they are baptized, &c but what shall
they do ,9 or what shall become of them Ξ They have
delivered their bodies to martyrdom, and what shall be-
come of them if their bodies rise not again? So J er. v. ult.
ΠῌἾἿζξζῄἷῖ ''wgo-³⁷9² W hat will pse clo in the end thereos?
that is, what will become of you ἓ

Thereu lies no sense in the words as to this sense which
we propound, but in the phrase ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν,[ον the dead:
which let us illustrate by a like phrase. The Jews baptized
a proselyto Ἶλ ΕΨΒ, under the motion οι· in the ocante of α
proselyte‚· and a servant to be set free aurnum 1:12²? wadel·
the motion or in the name of α libertina. But now when it was
said, ‘ N. is baptized 52³7 for α μνοεεῖῃΐες N. is baptized
ἻἾΠἾΚΖΞὈΚὩ sor a libertinex ; are not these words uttered well
in Greek, ‘O δεῖνα βαπτίζεται ὑπὲρ προσηλύτων, ὑπὲρ ἐλευθέρου,
such a one is baptizedjbr a proselyto, jer α free man.

II. If the rendering thc word ὑπὲρ in this sense seem
somcwhat uncouth, let it be supposed that the apostlc speaks
of washing and purification appointed to tho Jews after the
touching a dead body, and the rendering will be nearer.
