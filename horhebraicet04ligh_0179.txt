Ch. i. 12.] Emroz'tations upo'n 1 Epist. Corinth. 175

ι John v. 8, “ The spirit, and the water, and the blood?
yield a testimony of Christ on earth. ‘ The spirit‚‘ or the
gift of prophecy3 ‘ the water‚' or baptisnn and ‘the blood:
or martyrdom. For seeing the extraordinary gifts of the
Spirit did so abeund, and such infinite multitudes flocked to
baptism in the name of J esus, and very many for that name
endured martyrdom, it was an undoubted testimony that hc
was the true Messias.

Ver. 12: Ἐγὼ μέν εἰμι Παύλου, &Q I am of Paul, ἆρα]
To trace the original of this schism, we may have recourse
to the twofold division of this church into converted Jews
and Gentiles3 which appears from their story, Acts xviii.
The Gentile part perhaps boasted the name of Paul and
Apollos; the Jewish, that of Cephas and Christ. But each
of them again was divided into two. Some of the Gentile
part reverenced Paul either alone, or certainly above all
others, as their father, their apostle, and the first that brought
in the gospel among them3 however, he preached plainly, in a
low style, and not according to human wisdom and art. But
some preferred Apollos before him, as a more profound,
more elegant, and more quaint doctor: see Acts xviii. 24.
Hence that large discourse of the apostle of this very manner
of preaching, from chap. i. 17 to chap. iv. 6 ; where he saith,
that he transferred those things in a certain figure to himself
and Apollos. -

Ἐγὼ δὲ Κηφᾶ· Ami I of Oeplzas] Wv e will not here dispute
whether Peter were ever at Corinth. For even they them-
selves who assert that he was sometime there yet deny him
ever to have been there before the breaking out of this schism.
Whence therefore came there to be a sectg of his name? You
will scarce be able to produce a inore probable reason, than
that those of the circumcision embraced him who was the
minister of circumcision, rather than the minister of uncir-
cumcision. Let us take an example from Mark himself, the
son or disciple of Peter, 1 Pet. v. 13. He being chosen by
Paul and Barnabas for their companion in their travel among
the Gentiles, on a sudden departed from them and returned
to Jerusalem, Acts xiii. ¹3· And why so? I should bring
this reason of it, which you may correct if it displease, namely.
