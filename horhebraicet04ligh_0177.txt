had a double name, according to his double relation: the
Hebrew name ζὩἾδΞΨ Saul, as he was a Hebz‘ew ; the Roman
name Paul, as a Roman.

It was common in the Jewish nation, that among the Jews
they went by a Jewish name3 but among heathens by an-

heathen language3 as Tabitlm to the Jews was Dorcas to
them that spake Greek; and Thomas to the Hebrews was
Didymus to the G1·eeks; and perhaps Silas to the J ews was

names of the Gentiles.” Yea, hearken to what they say in
