Oh. xi.] Addenda to 1 Cor. xiv. 313

seeing for the most part they lived by their own laws and
ordinances, you will hardly any where show me, especially in
the times of the apostles, concerning which we speak, or in
the times before them, that they were compelled to reject the
one and to read the other.

And as to that which is objected concerning Philo and
Josephus, it is no wonder if they, writing for the heathen,
followed that version which was designedly made for the
heathen.

But that is of the greatest weight of all, which is objected
concerning the evangelists and apostles who embraced that
version in their quotations out of the Old Testament. To
which the answer is very easy; namely, those holy writers
had to do with two sorts of men, Jews and Gentiles: the
volume of the New Testament was in the hands of both. A
Gentile desires to examine the quotations which are brought
out of the Old Testament3 but not understanding the He-
brew, whither should he go but to the Greek version which
116 understands ἓ. So that .it was not only ἐκ συγκαταβάσεως,
out of condescension, that those holy writers followed the
Greek version, but out of pure necessity: for otherwise it
was impossible that their allegations out of the Law and the
Prophets could be examined by the Gentiles. And if a J eW‚
having the New Testament in his hand, should complain and
quarrel that in their quotations they departed from the He-
brew text, they had an answer ready, viz. this very version
which¹¹ is cited is that very same which ye have written, pub-
lished, and propounded to the world, as the symbol and token
of your lan and religion, and as your own very Bible.

If we would designedly attempt· a full disquisition con-
cerning that version, we might, it may be, more at large de-
monstrate all these things which have been spoken, by various
instances, reasons, and methods. But let this suffice at pre-
sent. This discourse was raised by occasion of the mention
of the ‘unknown tongue,' chap. xiv, which we suppose was
Hebrew, formerly used in the Hellenistical synagogue of the
Gorinthians, and which they would retain, being now con-
verted to the gospel ; too much wresting to J udaism the gift
of tongues, in the same manner as they did the other privi-
