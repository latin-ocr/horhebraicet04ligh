do not esteem that copy for the most genuine which comes
nearest to the Hebrew text, but that which comes nearest to
the mind of the translators in such like cautious.

It is said, as we saw before, that when the five elders had
turned the law, “that day was bitter to lsrael, as the day
wherein the golden calf was made.'' And why? “ Because
the law could not be turned according to all things conve-
nient to it.⁵' Did their grief arise hence, because it was not
turned, nor could not be, clearly, exactly, and evidently
enough, that the heathen might see the full aud open light
of it? Who will believe that this ever was the Jews' desire or
wish? But their trouble proceeded rather from hence, that
those five had not translated it euuningly, warily, and craftily
enough, as the Gentiles were to be dealt withal.

Of this matter there was care enough taken in this version;
the authors setting all their strength and wits on work, that,
according to their own pleasures, it might come forth such as
they would have it, and might serve their purpose both as to
themselves ancl as to the Gentiles. This they established
and strengthened by their own authority, not as a pure ver-
sion, and sueh as was to be recommended to their coun-
trymen, but as fit enough to stop the mouths and satisfy the
curiosity of the heathen, and lest any among them might
attempt another, in which those cautious and provisions
might not be sufficiently observed.

This they laid up in their Sanhedrims and synagogues,
that it might be ready, and shown to the heathen as a sym-
bol and token of the Jewish law, saith, aud religion, if at any
time the matter and necessity called for some such thing.

We grant, therefore. to Justin Martyr, that that version
was in the synagogues and hands of the Jews; but oue would
not conclude from that, that it was read 111 the synagogae
instead of the Hebrew text. And we will yield also to Ter-
tullian, that that version was read at Rome 111 his age, iu the
synagogues of the Jews3 but being compelled so to do by
that suspicion whereof we spake‚ namely, that it might be
known to all what the law and religion of the Jews was, whe-
ther it consisted with the Roman goverumeut. (hir question
is, VVhether the Hellenists ehose to themselves the reading of
the Greek version, and neglectcd 111(- Hebrew text ; aud
