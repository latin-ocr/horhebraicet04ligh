he is not worthy of that title :‘’ perhaps St. Paul knew of old
how wicked a person he had been; or from his present in-
justice or rash severity had reason enough to make such a
reply. To know instead of to own and aeknowledfye is not un-
usual in Scripture style. That is a sad and dreadful instance
enough, “I know you not; depart from me, ye workers of
iniquity !'’ And in the Jewish writings‚ when R. ‚Judah being
angry with Bar Kaphrah only said to him, ‘² I know thee not‚''
he went away as {PU one rabustel, and took ΠΞἾ] tlze rebuke
to himself. The story is thisi: “ When Bar Kaphrah came
to visit him, he said ωηο him, alm-,³22 *wan ”rs &asp an
‘ O Bar Isaphrak, I never knew thee.q He understood what he
meant: therefore he took tho rebuke unto himself for the
space of thirty days.''

Ver. 8¹< z Σαδδουκαῖοι μὲν γὰρ λέγουσι μὴ εἶναι ἀνάστασιν· The
Sadducees say tlmt there is no resurrection] What therefore

the promise of them made in the law, and he seeks for
nothing beyond the mere letter. That the Sacldzceees took
their denomination from one Sadoc, a disciple of Antigonus

In the mean time it may not be amiss to inquire whether
›S‘adoo did himself deny the resum²00t2†0n‚· and whether ho re-
jected all the books of the Holy Scripture excepting the five
books of Moses, which the Sadducees in some measure did.

Ι. The J ewish writers do relate his story with so much
variety, that, as some represent him, we might think he denied
{loe resurrection and future rewards; but, as others² that he
did not. For so say some¹: ‘³ sadoc and Baithus were the
heads of the heretics; for they erred coneerning the words of
their mastel·‚'' &e ‘¹ Sadocm and Baithus hearing this pas-
sage from their master, ‘ Be ye not as servants that serve their
master for hire and reward's sake 3' &e they said among· thern-
