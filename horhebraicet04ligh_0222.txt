serve a heathen, an atheist. an idolator, &cn Such questions

sold for a servant to a heathen ’ἐ VVhether an Israelite that is
a servant is to be pressed with the same service as a Ga-
naanite 3³²

If the apostle speaks directly, he does not discourse con-
cerning servants particularly, but of all Christiane in general.
And it is far from his intention to take away the relation that
is between masters and servants; but he admonisheth all
Ohristians that they serve not the evil lusts and wills of men,
but him that redeemed them with a price.

Ver. 26 m: Διὰ τὴν ἐνεστῶσαν ἀνάγκην· For the present ‘neces-
sity] And by and by, ver. 29, ὁ καιρὸς συνεσταλμένος, τὸ
λοιπόν ἐστι, the time is short, it remaz'netlz. The Oorinthians
iuquired of the apostle by a letter in the case of marriage, as
it seems by his answer :

I. Concerning marriages between a believer and an unbe-
liever, whether they were to be continued or not continued.

ΙΙ. Ooncerning the marriages of virgins or single persons
But now, how a scruple should arise to them in this latter, is
somewhat obscure. Among the J ewish Christians a scruple
might arise whether it were lawful for a single man to abstain
from marriage3 because in that nation, as we have observed,
they commanded matrimony by law. But if the question
were, whether it was lawful for a virgin or a single man to
contract matrimony, (for the apostle answereth οὐχ ἥμαρτες,
thou laast not siomecl, as though it were asked rather, whether
it were lawful to marry, than whether it were lawful not to
marry) then you will scarcely conjecture whence it should
arise but ἐξ ἐνεστώσης ἀνάγκης, from· the present necess-ily.

Our apostle teacheth, that some forbade marriage, 1 Tim.
iv.3. But under what pretence? Eithcr under this, that
they babblcd that marriage opposed the purity of the gospel,
as Saturninus in Irenaeus ¹¹3 or that they avoided marriages
for those calamities that hung ovcr them. “ They forbid
marriage (saith the apostlc), and command to abstain from
meats.’' Hear the Gemarists a little.
