Of the thirteen places that were clccmsrecl.

Bora Talmuds, as also other Rabbins who relate the story
of the seventy elders, add always this, tha-t “they changed
thirteen places in the law :'' which they also reckon up. But
now, when those different readings are not found in the
Greek version, that story is exploded by the most as a mere
fiction; when indeed the change was not in the version, but
in the Hebrew transeription. Let the thing speak itself:

They wrote, say they, ΠἺΒΪΝἻΞ ΝᾌΞτ Ε’Πῖῗζζ “ God created
in tlte befflz'nniny, Gen i. 1, not 0³³5ss ΝἾΥΞΤ, ΠἯρἃᾙ In the
beqimzinfy God created ,· lest the king.‚should say, Bel-eskillo is
eod, and there were two powers, and the first created the
latterffl.” But now, in the Greek version, it was impossible
that such a seruple should arise; it could arise only from the
Hebrewn text: and it must necessarily be that this change,
intended for an amendment, should be reckoned to be in the
Hebrew words themselves.

They write ΠἛΤἻρζὶ UT& ,ἺΠΨΠἾ And Sarah lazcyhed
among] her neiylcbours, Gen. xviii. 12, for ΠᾎἾῦςὶ within herser.

They wrote *neum nrm nri& ἻῸΠ NL) Whatsoever was
desirable I took not from them, Numb. xvi. ι 5, for 75:525 Ἶῂι]
one ass. Now who will doubt but that the change was made
in the Hebrew words themselves? In the former from the
affinity of the words; in the latter from the similitude of the
letters.

But instead of more, let this one example serve. They
wrote ῖῖδῖἾῖΠἾ ὋΞ. *mmm n& l'TlJ'lUW And lze sent 'rc-ortlcy
menO of the children of Israel, Exod. xxiv. 5, for ἾἾΣΞ-Πξῖζ
young] men. Now il‘ it be asked whether they wrote th'e very
word ἾωἾτΔΝτ, or the sense of it in the Greek language, the
Jerusalem Gemarists witness, that that very same word was
written by them in this story : “ Three books (say they) were
found in the court of the Temple. In one os them was writ-
ten D‘tp ᾓῃῖ, Deut. xxxiii. 27. In two was written mur:-
They received those two, and they rejected the third. ln ono
was written ἷῬΝἾζΖΒἺ '352 ”22mess ΠΝ ΠΙἬΖΡἾ lle sent 2002·th
