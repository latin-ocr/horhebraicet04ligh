You see how they ascribe it to the anyel of death, when any
violent, known, and ordinary cause and evident kind of death
doth not appear. So the apostle in this place mentioneth the
known and evident ways of death3 serpents, pestilenee, ver. 8‚9;
and now he speaks of the common kind of death (and not of
some evident plague)‚ whereby the whole multitude of those
that murmured perished, Numb. xiv„ within sorty years. He
saith they perished ὑπὸ τοῦ ὀλοθρευτοῦ, by that yreat destroyer,
the anyel of death.

Ver. Ι 1 : Εἷς οὓς τὰ τέλη τῶν αἰώνων, 820. Upon whom the ends
qftke world, dccx] He saith, τὰ τέλη τῶν αἰώνων, the ends os
tlze aye& not τὰ τέλη τοῦ κόσμου, the ends os the world. Αἰὼν,
aye, in the Scripture, very ordinarily is the Jewish aye. In
which sense circumcision, the Passover‚ and other Mosaic
rites, are said to be 0559& εἰς αἰῶνα, for cm aye. So the dis-
ciples, Matt. xxiv. 3, inquire of Christ περὶ τῆς συντελείας τοῦ
αἰῶνος, concerniny the end os the aym and he answereth con-
cerning the destruction of Jerusalem. In the same should Ι
render the words of the apostle, Tit. i. 23 “ To the hope of
eternal life, which God hath promised πρὸ χρόνων αἰωνίων be-
fore the times of the [Jewish] ayes:'' that is, God promised
eternal life before the Mosaio economy: that life therefore is
not to be expected by the works of the law of Moses,

Thus, therefore, the apostle speaks in this place: ‘⁶ These
things which were transacted in the beginning of the J ewish
ages aro written for an example to you, upon whom the ends
of those ages are come. And 13116 beginning is like to the
end, and the end to the beginning. Both was forty years,
both consisted of temptation and unbelief, and both ending
in the destruction of unbelicvers: that in the destruction of
those that perished in the wilderncss 3 this in the destruction
of those that believed not in the destruction of 1110 city and
nation.'’
